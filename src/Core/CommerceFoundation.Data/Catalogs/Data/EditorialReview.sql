This can be a cable box with a subscription to a 3D channel, a 3D Blu-ray Disc player, or a PlayStation 3 system.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center" valign="middle"><img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/3dcl-3.jpg" /></td> <td valign="middle"><span class="h3color"><strong>3D Content</strong></span><br />3D content--the actual entertainment, in other words--will be played back using the source mentioned above, whether it''s a 3D broadcast from your cable provider, a 3D Blu-ray Disc, or a 3D video game.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center" valign="middle"><img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/3dcl-4.jpg" /></td> <td valign="middle"><span class="h3color"><strong>3D Glasses</strong></span><br />For now, the vast majority of 3D HDTVs require glasses for 3D viewing. Many use powered "active shutter" glasses, others polarized "passive" glasses. You''ll need one pair per viewer, and they''ll have to be compatible with your display, whether they''re the same brand, or a pair of "universal" glasses designed to work across brands.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center" valign="middle"><img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/3dcl-5.jpg" /></td> <td valign="middle"><span class="h3color"><strong>HDMI Cable</strong></span><br />To connect your source (such as a 3D Blu-ray Disc player) to your display, you''ll need a high-speed HDMI cable.

It is loaded with advanced power management features and an integrated battery, which work together to provide up to 7 hours of wireless web browsing. You may notice an unfamiliar logo next to one of the ports on the left side of the system. This is Thunderbolt, a high-speed interface that can move data at an amazing 10Gbps, which is double that of USB 3.0. The Thunderbolt port also doubles as a display output because it shares the same physical form factor as a Mini DisplayPort. You can daisy-chain up to six devices, so you''ll be able to connect high-speed external storage and an external Apple LED Cinema display via the same port!      The computer''s 13.3" display features LED backlight technology and a glossy finish. Its 1280 x 800 native resolution gives you ample screen space to work with. You''ll be able to output to an external display at up to 2560 x 1600 via Thunderbolt. Any Mini DisplayPort-compatible display will plug in without the need of an adapter. If you have a display with DVI, VGA or HDMI input, you''ll only need to purchase an adapter cable (i.e., HDMI-to-Mini DisplayPort) for connection.

As beautiful as it is wearable.</h2> <p><strong>Sleek, polished aluminum. Five brilliant colors.</strong><br /> Its main body is crafted from a single piece of aluminum and polished to a beautiful shine, so the new iPod shuffle feels solid, sleek, and durable. And the color palette makes it the perfect fashion accessory. Choose gleaming silver, blue, green, orange, or pink.</p> <p><strong>Hundreds of songs to go</strong><br /> Never leave a favorite tune behind. Along with up to 15 hours of battery life, iPod shuffle gives you 2 GB of storage capacity, good for hundreds of songs. That''s plenty of room for the essential songs for your workout or commute. And for multiple playlists, Genius Mixes, podcasts, and audiobooks.</p> <p><strong>Goes anywhere. And with anything.</strong><br /> iPod shuffle isn''t just portable. It''s wearable, too. Clip it to your shirt, jacket, workout gear, backpack, or purse strap, and it stays put--whether you''re running an errand or running around the track.</p> <h2>Controls. Right on the button.</h2> <p><strong>Control your music with just a click</strong><br /> It''s back--the big, clickable control pad on the front of iPod shuffle. It''s 18 percent larger than on previous iPod shuffle models, so it''s even easier to see and use the music controls. Press the center button to play and pause. Press the outer buttons to skip forward or back and adjust volume. Click, click, click. It''s music to your fingers.</p> <p><strong>Play it your way</strong><br /> Maybe you''re the spontaneous type. Or maybe you prefer a little order. Just flip the shuffle switch to suit your listening style. Flip it to the left, and you''ll hear your music in a refreshingly random way. Flip it to the middle, and your songs play in order. Or flip to the right to turn iPod shuffle off.</p> <h2>VoiceOver. It tells you what you want to hear.</h2> <p><strong>Give your songs a voice</strong><br /> Say you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist. Just press the new VoiceOver button on top of your iPod shuffle, and it tells you. You can even use VoiceOver to hear the names of playlists and switch between them. And if your battery needs charging, VoiceOver tells you that, too.</p> <p><strong>It speaks your language</strong><br /> A French love song. A Spanish bolero. An Italian cantata. Your music library has songs from all over the world. That''s why VoiceOver speaks 25 different languages. So it can tell you song titles and artists in their native tongues or any language you choose.</p> <h2>Playlists. The perfect mix for every mood.</h2> <p><strong>Sync to your heart''s content</strong><br /> iTunes on your Mac or PC makes it easy to load up your iPod shuffle. Just choose the playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio files you want, then sync.</p> <p><strong>When one playlist isn''t enough</strong><br /> You probably have multiple playlists in iTunes on your computer. One for your commute. One for the gym. One for just relaxing. Sync all those playlists to iPod shuffle, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever mood strikes you. VoiceOver tells you the name of each playlist, so it''s easy to switch between them and find the one you want without looking.</p> <p><strong>Genius comes to iPod shuffle</strong><br /> There''s another way to get a good mix of music on iPod shuffle: let Genius do the work. Activate Genius in iTunes on your computer, and it automatically finds songs that sound great together. Then it creates Genius Mixes, which you can easily sync to your iPod shuffle. It''s the perfect way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in, like, forever.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box?</h2> <p>2 GB iPod shuffle (blue), Apple earphones, iPod shuffle USB cable (45 mm), quick start guide, and other important product information.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b001fa1nuu',N'20120319 22:00:40.903',N'20120319 22:00:40.903',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

So you can do things with these apps that you can''t do on any other device.The high-resolution, 9.7-inch LED-backlit IPS display on iPad is remarkably crisp and vivid. Which makes it perfect for web browsing, watching movies, or viewing photos. With iPad, there is no up or down. It''s designed to show off your content in portrait or landscape orientation with every turn. And because it uses a display technology called IPS (in-plane switching), it has a wide viewing angle. So you can hold it almost any way you want and still get a brilliant picture, with excellent color and contrast.The multi-touch screen on iPad is based on the same revolutionary technology on iPhone. But the technology has been completely reengineered for the larger iPad surface, making it extremely precise and responsive. So whether you''re zooming in on a map, flicking through your photos, or deleting an email, iPad responds with incredible accuracy. And it does just what you want it to.One of the first things you''ll notice about iPad is how thin and light it is. The screen is 9.7 inches measured diagonally. So overall, it''s slightly smaller than a magazine. You can use it anywhere. And a slight curve to the back makes it easy to pick up and comfortable to hold.With built-in 802.11n, iPad takes advantage of the fastest Wi-Fi networks. It automatically locates available Wi-Fi networks, which you can join with a few taps. iPad also comes with Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR, letting you connect to devices like wireless headphones or the Apple wireless keyboard.',2,NULL,N'v-b00365f6eg',N'20120319 22:02:07.117',N'20120319 22:02:07.117',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

multimedia services, and gives you the advantage of offering simultaneous voice and data services. <p></p> <p>In areas where the 3G network is not available, you''ll continue to receive service on the AT&T EDGE network, which offers availability in more than 13,000 U.S. cities and along some 40,000 miles of major highways. It''s fast enough to support a wide range of advanced data services, including full picture and video messaging, high-speed color Internet access, and e-mail on the go.</p> <strong>Easy Pay-As-You-Go Data Plan Options</strong><br /> <p>AT&T offers two pay-as-you-go data plan options for the Galaxy Tab--a $14.99 plan for 30 days with up to 250 MB of usage and a $25 plan for 30 days with up to 2 GB of usage. If you use all the data included in your plan before 30 days, you can purchase another pay-as-you go plan. The data plans do not require a long-term contract.</p> <p>As a courtesy reminder, AT&T will notify you when the 30-day plan is close to expiring or when you are close to depleting the amount of data available in the plan. For additional convenience, these plans can automatically renew every 30 days (when paid for using a credit card or debit card).</p> <p>You''ll also enjoy easy on-device wireless activation and account management. Tapping "Activate" on the AT&T Account Manager begins the quick wireless service activation process. Tapping "Buy More Credit" on the AT&T Account Manager on device (with active wireless service) allows for quick access to view remaining data/time, purchase more data, add a device, or edit information about your account.</p> <h2><a name="swype">Swype Keyboard</h2> <p>An alternative to the Android virtual keyboard, the Swype virtual keyboard allows you to input text by swiping the finger with one continuous finger or stylus motion across the screen keyboard. Based on testing, speed and accuracy are equal to or better than the traditional keyboard-tapping method. You can activate the Swype keyboard by pressing and holding in a text field, waiting for popup to appear, clicking Input Method, and then selecting Swype.</p> <p>A key advantage to Swype is that by roughly aiming to pass through the letters of the word there is no need to be very accurate, enabling rapid text entry.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b004cyeqf0',N'20120319 22:00:18.317',N'20120319 22:00:18.317',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

This compact unit is full-featured enough for the multimedia enthusiast but easy enough to navigate through and use for the complete digital-age newcomer, and it''s the perfect companion for everything from sitting on a bus on your way to school, to going to the gym.<p>  The primary purpose of the Samsung YP-T9JQB is, of course, to play music, for which this audio player is well equipped. Compatible with MP3, WMA, and protected WMA DRM (digital rights management) 10 audio formats, the T9 features DNSe (digital natural sound engine) technology for a clear, full sound, and a 9-band customizable EQ with 11 preset modes for all types of musical preferences. This unit supports playlists, as well as an internal favorites list that acts as an on-the-go playlist, and is subscription service compatible (Janus DRM). All the regular modes of playback are included, such as repeat, repeat one, shuffle, and normal, but this unit also includes a variable playback speed setting that speeds-up or slows-down your music from 3x to -3x the recorded speed. Furthermore, to protect your sensitive hearing Samsung''s T9 series has an option to limit the audio output level so you don''t accidentally damage your ears due to uneven recording volumes.<p>  Unlike many MP3 players, the YP-T9JQB doesn''t just limit you to the music you already have. The built-in FM tuner will scan the entire FM range in under 60 seconds, and automatically place the available FM stations in to presets. To eliminate stations with marginal reception, users can adjust the sensitivity to only preset stations with a strong reception. What''s more, the T9 will actually let you record directly from FM in MP3 format for playback later, even allowing you to select recording quality ranging from 96 to 192 kbps. And since this unit has a built-in microphone as well, you can also choose to record live sound or your own audio notes, also in MP3 format ranging from 32 to 128 kbps in quality, so you never need to miss a lecture or catch every word of a presentation again.<p>  More than just a music player, the Samsung YP-T9JQB supports the playback of video in the MPEG4 file format, with a video resolution of 208 x 176 pixels at a frame rate of 15 fps. This unit even comes with Samsung''s Multimedia Software that transcodes the video on your computer before transferring it to your multimedia player so the files on your T9 play at an optimal frame size and rate with minimal effort on your part. This Samsung multimedia player will also allow you to view JPEG images, complete with the ability to zoom and re-center an image, and set any saved JPEG image as your wallpaper to be used during music playback. And for those users constantly on the go, the YP-T9JQB allows you to view text files in customizable views, and delete files directly from your player without having to use a computer, so you can download the mornings email and take it with you on your way to the office, school, or an important meeting. But Samsung doesn''t stop there, preloading the T9 with built-in flash games including Baseball and Pizza Delivery, as well as the ability to download new flash games and even delete current ones to make room for more.<p>  The Samsung T9 multimedia player is built with a macromedia portable user interface with simple, intuitive menus and a 5-button front side controller. Menu navigation as well as video and pictures are displayed on a sharp, clear 1.8-inch TFT LCD with 262,000 colors and an adjustable brightness ranging from zero to 10. This unit supports 16 different languages for your menu view, and 32 different languages for ID3 tag information. The T9 allows you to choose between five different menu colors, even allowing you to shuffle colors at random so you get a different one every time you turn the unit on. During music playback you can set the display to show flash visualizers, JPEG photos, or the album cover art of what is playing, and power-saving features let you adjust your screen saver, sleep timer, LCD off and auto power-off settings.<p>  The Samsung YP-T9JQB comes with two gigabytes of internal flash memory for storing up to 500 songs at 128 kbps, up to 20,000 JPEG photos, or up to 138 hours of audio recordings at 32 kbps. This unit has a built-in, rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery with a capacity of 740 mAh that allows up to 30 hours of audio play time, or up to six hours of video play time. The Samsung T9 has a 20 mWatts per-channel output, and includes a USB 2.0 connector for interfacing with your PC, as well as a 24-pin UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) chip and 3.5mm earphone out connector. This multimedia player requires Windows XP or higher for subscription services, and comes with a pair of EP-370 balanced earphones so you can start listening to your music from the very first day. The YP-T9JQB comes with a stylish black finish, weighs only 1.73 ounces, measures just 1.68 x 3.27 x 0.44 inches (W x H x D).<p>  <b>What''s in the Box</b><br> Samsung YP-T9JQB 2 GB digital audio player, 1 x pair of EP balanced earphones, 1 x USB cable, installation CD with Samsung Media Studio software, and a user''s manual.',2,NULL,N'v-b000ixmvgu',N'20120319 21:59:10.827',N'20120319 21:59:10.827',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Lace up a pair of Nike+ running shoes and clip on your iPod nano. You''ll watch the miles unfold and hear real-time voice feedback along with your favorite songs. In the gym, connect iPod nano to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio machine. It records your pace, time, and distance as you work out and rock out.</p> <h2>iTunes. For your iPod-playing pleasure.</h2> <p><strong>Everything you need to be entertained.</strong><br /> iTunes is the best way to fill your iPod nano with the latest music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more.

The Genius sidebar recommends new music based on the songs you already love. When you find something that sparks your interest, listen to the free 30-second preview. Click once to buy the song and it starts downloading instantly. It''s the fastest, easiest way to build a digital music collection for your iPod nano.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p><strong>Built-in accessibility.</strong><br /> iPod nano comes with accessibility features that help people with disabilities enjoy music, audiobooks, and more.</p> <p><strong>VoiceOver</strong><br /> iPod nano features VoiceOver, the world''s first gesture-based screen reader. Touch the screen to hear a description of the item under your finger, then double-tap, drag, or flick to control iPod nano. Use the optional Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic to control your music without looking at the screen. VoiceOver tells you the name of the song or artist--and it speaks 29 languages.</p> <p><strong>White on Black</strong><br /> If you prefer higher contrast, iPod nano lets you change the display to white on black. Use the White on Black feature in any application, as well as on the Home screen.</p>  <p><strong>Mono Audio</strong><br /> If your hearing is limited in one ear, turn on Mono Audio to route audio into both earbuds so you can hear both channels in either ear.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box</h2> <p>16GB iPod nano (Orange), Apple Earphones, Dock Connector to USB Cable, Quick Start Guide and Important Product Information</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b002m3so1k',N'20120319 22:00:56.547',N'20120319 22:00:56.547',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

And the color palette makes it the perfect fashion accessory. Choose gleaming silver, blue, green, orange, or pink.</p> <p><strong>Hundreds of songs to go</strong><br /> Never leave a favorite tune behind. Along with up to 15 hours of battery life, iPod shuffle gives you 2 GB of storage capacity, good for hundreds of songs. That''s plenty of room for the essential songs for your workout or commute. And for multiple playlists, Genius Mixes, podcasts, and audiobooks.</p> <p><strong>Goes anywhere. And with anything.</strong><br /> iPod shuffle isn''t just portable. It''s wearable, too. Clip it to your shirt, jacket, workout gear, backpack, or purse strap, and it stays put--whether you''re running an errand or running around the track.</p> <h2>Controls. Right on the button.</h2> <p><strong>Control your music with just a click</strong><br /> It''s back--the big, clickable control pad on the front of iPod shuffle. It''s 18 percent larger than on previous iPod shuffle models, so it''s even easier to see and use the music controls. Press the center button to play and pause. Press the outer buttons to skip forward or back and adjust volume. Click, click, click. It''s music to your fingers.</p> <p><strong>Play it your way</strong><br /> Maybe you''re the spontaneous type. Or maybe you prefer a little order. Just flip the shuffle switch to suit your listening style. Flip it to the left, and you''ll hear your music in a refreshingly random way. Flip it to the middle, and your songs play in order. Or flip to the right to turn iPod shuffle off.</p> <h2>VoiceOver. It tells you what you want to hear.</h2> <p><strong>Give your songs a voice</strong><br /> Say you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist. Just press the new VoiceOver button on top of your iPod shuffle, and it tells you. You can even use VoiceOver to hear the names of playlists and switch between them. And if your battery needs charging, VoiceOver tells you that, too.</p> <p><strong>It speaks your language</strong><br /> A French love song. A Spanish bolero. An Italian cantata. Your music library has songs from all over the world. That''s why VoiceOver speaks 25 different languages. So it can tell you song titles and artists in their native tongues or any language you choose.</p> <h2>Playlists. The perfect mix for every mood.</h2> <p><strong>Sync to your heart''s content</strong><br /> iTunes on your Mac or PC makes it easy to load up your iPod shuffle. Just choose the playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio files you want, then sync.</p> <p><strong>When one playlist isn''t enough</strong><br /> You probably have multiple playlists in iTunes on your computer. One for your commute. One for the gym. One for just relaxing. Sync all those playlists to iPod shuffle, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever mood strikes you. VoiceOver tells you the name of each playlist, so it''s easy to switch between them and find the one you want without looking.</p> <p><strong>Genius comes to iPod shuffle</strong><br /> There''s another way to get a good mix of music on iPod shuffle: let Genius do the work. Activate Genius in iTunes on your computer, and it automatically finds songs that sound great together. Then it creates Genius Mixes, which you can easily sync to your iPod shuffle. It''s the perfect way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in, like, forever.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box?</h2> <p>2 GB iPod shuffle (green), Apple earphones, iPod shuffle USB cable (45 mm), quick start guide, and other important product information.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b001fa1nvo',N'20120319 22:00:42.443',N'20120319 22:00:42.443',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Visit the App Store to choose from over 500,000 apps. iPod touch also features iCloud, which stores your music, photos, apps, and moreÑand wirelessly pushes them to all your devices.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:350px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-1.jpg" width="250" height="279" alt="iPod touch" />     <div class="imageCaption"> On the front of iPod touch is a built-in camera perfect for making FaceTime video calls. </div> </div>    <h4>FaceTime. Oh, I see what you''re saying.</h4> <p>Video calling on iPod touch means your friends can see what you''re up to, when you''re up to it. With a tap, you can call someone on an iPhone, iPad 2, iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi. And come face-to-face with even more fun.</p>  <h5>Tap for a more instant, instant message.</h5> <p>Take "LOL" to the next level and actually see friends laughing. Or bring "XOXO" to life when you blow someone a kiss from miles away. FaceTime on iPod touch makes it possible. FaceTime works right out of the box--just enter your Apple ID and email address. Or create a new email account just for FaceTime. Using FaceTime is as easy as it gets. Say you want to start a video call with your best friend over Wi-Fi. Just tap the FaceTime app and find her entry to start the call. An invitation pops up on her screen asking if she wants to join you. When she accepts, FaceTime begins. It''s all perfectly seamless. And it works in both portrait and landscape. See how much fun you can have.</p>  <h5>Two cameras make either side its fun side.</h5> <p>iPod touch has two built-in cameras, one on the front above the display and one on the back. The front camera has been tuned for FaceTime. It has just the right field of view and focal length to focus on your face at arm''s length. So it always presents you in the best possible light. Which is especially handy when you''re talking to someone who''s more than just a friend.</p>  <h5>The back camera. See and share.</h5> <p>So your friend is sick with a cold and can''t make it to the concert. You can share the encore with a FaceTime call. As the band takes the stage and starts playing one of her all-time favorite songs, just tap a button. And before the lead singer can belt out his first note, iPod touch switches to the back camera and to the sure-to-be-legendary performance. Another tap switches to the front camera and to you. Simple, fast, and fun.</p>  <h4>Camera with HD Video Recording. Ready, and action.</h4> <p>The next great Internet meme could be yours. iPod touch and its HD video camera go with you everywhere, so you can capture every "What the?" moment that comes your way.</p>  <h5>Trim a little off the ends. Or the middle.</h5> <p>No need to wait until you''re back at your computer to edit video. With basic editing built into iPod touch, you can get right down to business. Just drag to select start and end points on a filmstrip. Keep only the parts of the video you want, and turn it into something you and your friends will watch again and again.</p>   <div class="rightImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-2.jpg" width="225" height="124" alt="iPod touch Camera" />     <div class="imageCaption">iPod touch features a second camera on the back, which lets you shoot amazing 720p HD video. </div> </div>    <h5>Special guest star: iMovie.</h5> <p>You''re on an epic road trip, and you want to create a video postcard of everything you''ve seen and done. Just use the iMovie app--pick it up on the App Store for just $4.99. Built for Multi-Touch, iMovie lets you combine and edit video clips, give them that extra something with dynamic themes, add music and photos, and share your finished movies with the world.</p>  <h5>This is so going on YouTube.</h5> <p>Maybe you''re in the middle of texting a friend or browsing the web when you look up and suddenly see something that words just can''t describe. Launch the camera and record on the fly. Then upload your HD movie directly to YouTube. Or select some video from the Camera Roll and attach it to a new email message, ready to send. Posting to your Facebook page or blog is also just a tap away.</p>  <h5>Two cameras. Countless photo ops.</h5> <p>A really cool piece of graffiti art. A cupcake too cute to eat. Your cat camouflaged by stuffed animals. If you want to take a quick photo to post on Twitter, either camera on iPod touch can also capture stills. Use grid lines, pinch-to-zoom gestures, and single-tap exposure lock to compose the perfect shot. Then tap to tweet at will.</p>     <h4>Retina Display. Seeing is still not believing.</h4> <p>Thanks to the Retina display, everything you see and do on iPod touch looks amazing. That''s because the Retina display''s pixel density is so high your eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. Which means images in games, movies, and photos pop off the screen. Text in books, web pages, and email is crisp at any size. And everything is sharper. No wonder it''s called "cutting edge."</p>   <div class="leftImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-3.jpg" width="150" height="261" alt="iPod touch Music" />     <div class="imageCaption">When iPod came on the scene years ago, it was all about music--and it still is. Enjoy your favorite tunes, whether it''s on headphones or wirelessly over AirPlay. </div> </div>   <h5>More wow per inch.</h5> <p>Behind the screen of iPod touch, there''s some serious technology going on.

If you come from a right-click world, you can configure a right-click area on the trackpad or simply press with two fingers.</p> <p> <table align="center" cellpadding="10" width="800"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="199" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-macbook-102009-multitouch-800.jpg" width="800" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>Some of the multi-touch gestures you can perform with the MacBook.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <p><strong>Wireless That Works</strong><br /> Connect to the Internet at fast speeds anywhere thanks to the built-in AirPort Extreme 802.11n Wi-Fi. Like everything else about a Mac, joining Wi-Fi networks couldn''t be simpler. If you''ve previously connected to a network, your Mac automatically logs you in so you can immediately email, surf the web, or video chat. Have a Bluetooth-enabled phone, headset, keyboard, or mouse? They can all connect to your MacBook courtesy of built-in Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR--and it remembers all your devices, too</p> <p><strong>Innovative Power Cord</strong><br /> The MagSafe Power Adapter has a magnetic connection instead of a physical one. So if someone happens to trip over the power cord while you''re working, they won''t send your new MacBook flying off a table or desk. Instead, the cord breaks cleanly away, without damage to either the cord or the system. As a bonus, you can tell if your MacBook is fully charged when the LED on the connector changes from amber to green.</p> <p><strong>Easy Access To Connections And Ports</strong><br /> The connections and ports on MacBook--MagSafe power, Gigabit Ethernet, Mini DisplayPort, USB, and audio in/out--are all smartly integrated on the same side of the notebook. So your cables stay neatly organized, and connecting and disconnecting your devices is easy and convenient.</p> <p> <table align="center" cellpadding="10" width="900"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="183" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-macbook-102009-ports-900.jpg" width="900" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <p></p> <h2>Pre-Loaded with Mac OS X Snow Leopard and iLife ''09</h2> <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="350"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="322" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-mac-feature-snowleopard.jpg" width="350" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Every Mac comes with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the world''s most advanced operating system, and iLife, Apple''s innovative suite of applications for managing photos, making movies and creating and learning to play music. Snow Leopard builds on a decade of OS X innovation and success with hundreds of refinements, new core technologies and out of the box support for Microsoft Exchange. iLife features iPhoto, to easily organize and manage photos; iMovie with powerful easy-to-use new features such as Precision Editor, video stabilization and advanced drag and drop; and GarageBand which introduces a whole new way to help you learn to play piano and guitar. <p><strong>Installed software</strong><br /></p> <ul> <li>Mac OS X v10.6 Snow Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) </li> <li>iLife ''09 (includes iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, iWeb, iDVD) </li> </ul> <p></p> <h2>@ Design</h2> <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="250"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="243" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-macbook-102009-enviro-250.jpg" width="250" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Because Apple designs both hardware and software, we can reduce our environmental footprint in ways others can''t. For starters, a highly efficient power supply reduces the amount of power wasted when bringing electricity from the wall to your Mac. Unlike a lot of PCs, a Mac uses energy-efficient hardware components that work hand in hand with the operating system to conserve power--even between keystrokes. <p>A Mac also doesn''t contain a lot of toxic materials. All Mac displays are mercury and arsenic free, and the internal components are free of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and brominated flame retardants (BFRs).</p> <p><strong>Advanced Power Management</strong><br /> Unlike a lot of Windows-based PC systems, MacBook uses energy-efficient hardware components that work hand in hand with the operating system to conserve power. Mac OS X spins down hard drives and activates sleep mode on already energy-efficient LED-backlit displays. And it balances tasks across both central processors and graphics processors. Mac OS X never misses a power-saving opportunity, no matter how small. It even regulates the processor between keystrokes, reducing power between the letters you type. That''s just one of many ways Apple manages small amounts of power that add up to big savings.</p> <p><strong>Longer-lasting Battery--Lasts up to 5 Years</strong><br /> The removable batteries in most notebooks are designed to be replaced every year or two, which means lots of batteries are used up and discarded. But the battery in the new MacBook lasts up to five years--or 1000 recharges. So it uses just one battery in the same time a typical notebook uses three, reducing waste and environmental impact. And to help ensure that batteries are disposed of in an environmentally responsible way, Apple offers a battery take-back program in 95 percent of the countries in which it does business.</p> <p><strong>ENERGY STAR Qualification</strong><br /> The MacBook meets the stringent low power requirements set by the EPA, making it ENERGY STAR qualified. ENERGY STAR 5.0 sets significantly higher efficiency limits for power supplies and aggressive limits for the computer''s typical annual power consumption.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b002qq8eko',N'20120319 22:02:15.897',N'20120319 22:02:15.897',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Available in three flavors, the iBook G4 doesn’t sport PowerBook amenities such as DVD burning and massive widescreen displays, yet all three models feature superb connectivity, subcompact dimensions, and impressive battery life. This particular unit, the entry-level iBook G4 12-inch M9164LL/A, is the most affordable mobile computer in the entire Apple roster. <P> Featuring a spry power section consisting of an 800 MHz PowerPC G4 processor and 256 MB RAM (expandable to 640 MB), the system packs enough raw muscle for most typical mobile computing tasks. However, the real surprise comes in its 3-D rendering capabilities. Unlike many comparably equipped notebooks, the iBook G4 12-inch features an ATI Mobility Radeon 9200 video chipset with 32 MB of dedicated DDR SDRAM memory. Thusly, it will efficiently handle demanding applications such as 3-D drawing and even some 3-D gaming. <P> At just 11.2 by 9.1 by 1.3 inches and a scant 4.9 pounds, the iBook G4 12-inch is downright tiny. Yet when you flip the lid you’ll find such desirable perks as a full-size 77-key keyboard with 12 function keys and four arrow keys, a trackpad with double-tap and drag capabilities, a smallish but crystal clear 12.1-inch display capable of 1024x768 resolution, and a combination CD-RW/DVD-ROM drive through which you can burn audio CDs, archive files and play the latest Hollywood blockbusters. For storing your files, Apple has installed a serviceable 30 GB hard disk -- enough space for general use but too little for serious multimedia archiving. <P> Connectivity options include an integrated 56K modem for dial-up communications, a 10/100BASE-T Ethernet port for LAN and high-speed Internet and email, and two high-speed USB 2.0 ports and one FireWire 400 port for external high-tech toys such as scanners, digital cameras and digital camcorders. Users can also purchase an Apple AirPort Extreme Card for wireless communication and an internal Bluetooth module to interact with future cordless Bluetooth devices such as cell phones and PDAs. <P> Bundled software includes Apple’s newest operating system, Mac OS X v.10.3 Panther, and a broad range of highly useable multimedia utilities. Under ideal conditions, battery life is estimated at a stunning six hours.',2,NULL,N'v-b0000u9h40',N'20120319 22:01:02.320',N'20120319 22:01:02.320',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

The 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro now feature quad-core Intel Core i7 processors. And the 13-inch models jump to dual-core Intel Core i5 and i7 processors. New Thunderbolt technology lets you connect high-performance peripherals and high-resolution displays to one port - with data transfer rates up to 10 Gbps.

To connect a DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA display, just use an existing optional adapter. AMD Radeon graphics on the 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro are up to 3x faster than those in previous models, so you can take everything from games to CAD to HD video projects anywhere.

A Sweep Panorama mode makes it a snap to produce a truly impressive ultra wide-angle 360Deg. panoramic photo, even without a tripod and SteadyShot image stabilization plus sensitivity up to 3200 ISO means you can wave good-bye to blurry pictures, even in dim lighting situations.Friends and family will love the way they look in your photos when you''re using the Smile Shutter (captures a smile the moment it appears on your subject''s face), Anti-Blink (waits until eyes are open to take the picture) and Soft Skin (removes blemishes and wrinkles from faces in your pictures) modes. And, best of all, the W650 will do it all automatically--just press the shutter button in iAuto mode. Great pictures and videos, no stress or strain for you.',2,NULL,N'v-b006k5551i',N'20120319 21:56:55.650',N'20120319 21:56:55.650',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Oh, I see what you''re saying.</h4> <p>Video calling on iPod touch means your friends can see what you''re up to, when you''re up to it. With a tap, you can call someone on an iPhone, iPad 2, iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi. And come face-to-face with even more fun.</p>  <h5>Tap for a more instant, instant message.</h5> <p>Take "LOL" to the next level and actually see friends laughing. Or bring "XOXO" to life when you blow someone a kiss from miles away. FaceTime on iPod touch makes it possible. FaceTime works right out of the box--just enter your Apple ID and email address. Or create a new email account just for FaceTime. Using FaceTime is as easy as it gets. Say you want to start a video call with your best friend over Wi-Fi. Just tap the FaceTime app and find her entry to start the call. An invitation pops up on her screen asking if she wants to join you. When she accepts, FaceTime begins. It''s all perfectly seamless. And it works in both portrait and landscape. See how much fun you can have.</p>  <h5>Two cameras make either side its fun side.</h5> <p>iPod touch has two built-in cameras, one on the front above the display and one on the back. The front camera has been tuned for FaceTime. It has just the right field of view and focal length to focus on your face at arm''s length. So it always presents you in the best possible light. Which is especially handy when you''re talking to someone who''s more than just a friend.</p>  <h5>The back camera. See and share.</h5> <p>So your friend is sick with a cold and can''t make it to the concert. You can share the encore with a FaceTime call. As the band takes the stage and starts playing one of her all-time favorite songs, just tap a button. And before the lead singer can belt out his first note, iPod touch switches to the back camera and to the sure-to-be-legendary performance. Another tap switches to the front camera and to you. Simple, fast, and fun.</p>  <h4>Camera with HD Video Recording. Ready, and action.</h4> <p>The next great Internet meme could be yours. iPod touch and its HD video camera go with you everywhere, so you can capture every "What the?" moment that comes your way.</p>  <h5>Trim a little off the ends. Or the middle.</h5> <p>No need to wait until you''re back at your computer to edit video. With basic editing built into iPod touch, you can get right down to business. Just drag to select start and end points on a filmstrip. Keep only the parts of the video you want, and turn it into something you and your friends will watch again and again.</p>   <div class="rightImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-2.jpg" width="225" height="124" alt="iPod touch Camera" />     <div class="imageCaption">iPod touch features a second camera on the back, which lets you shoot amazing 720p HD video. </div> </div>    <h5>Special guest star: iMovie.</h5> <p>You''re on an epic road trip, and you want to create a video postcard of everything you''ve seen and done. Just use the iMovie app--pick it up on the App Store for just $4.99. Built for Multi-Touch, iMovie lets you combine and edit video clips, give them that extra something with dynamic themes, add music and photos, and share your finished movies with the world.</p>  <h5>This is so going on YouTube.</h5> <p>Maybe you''re in the middle of texting a friend or browsing the web when you look up and suddenly see something that words just can''t describe. Launch the camera and record on the fly. Then upload your HD movie directly to YouTube. Or select some video from the Camera Roll and attach it to a new email message, ready to send. Posting to your Facebook page or blog is also just a tap away.</p>  <h5>Two cameras. Countless photo ops.</h5> <p>A really cool piece of graffiti art. A cupcake too cute to eat. Your cat camouflaged by stuffed animals. If you want to take a quick photo to post on Twitter, either camera on iPod touch can also capture stills. Use grid lines, pinch-to-zoom gestures, and single-tap exposure lock to compose the perfect shot. Then tap to tweet at will.</p>     <h4>Retina Display. Seeing is still not believing.</h4> <p>Thanks to the Retina display, everything you see and do on iPod touch looks amazing. That''s because the Retina display''s pixel density is so high your eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. Which means images in games, movies, and photos pop off the screen. Text in books, web pages, and email is crisp at any size. And everything is sharper. No wonder it''s called "cutting edge."</p>   <div class="leftImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-3.jpg" width="150" height="261" alt="iPod touch Music" />     <div class="imageCaption">When iPod came on the scene years ago, it was all about music--and it still is. Enjoy your favorite tunes, whether it''s on headphones or wirelessly over AirPlay. </div> </div>   <h5>More wow per inch.</h5> <p>Behind the screen of iPod touch, there''s some serious technology going on. By developing pixels a mere 78 micrometers wide, Apple engineers were able to pack four times the number of pixels into the same size screen found on earlier iPod touch models. This many pixels packed this close together--326 per inch--make graphics and text look smooth and continuous at any size. Prepare to be glued to the screen.</p>  <h5>LED backlighting.</h5> <p>The Retina display includes LED backlighting and an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen for the best viewing and battery life possible. So you can focus on more important things. Like destroying aliens.</p>    <h4>AirPlay. Broadcast live to your HDTV and speakers.</h4> <p>With AirPlay, you can wirelessly stream what''s on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your HDTV and speakers via Apple TV. That''s gonna go over big.</p>  <h5>Give your photos and video the big-screen treatment.</h5> <p>You have great photos on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and some friends on your couch. Or you''re in the middle of an epic action scene that could use a little more screen. Tap the AirPlay icon on your iOS 5 device from a specific app--Photos, Videos, or Safari, for example--and everything streams to your HDTV via your Apple TV.* Make sure both your device and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and the AirPlay icon appears automatically.</p>  <h5>DJ wirelessly.</h5> <p>AirPlay isn''t just for photos, movies, and apps. It''s for your music, too. A song, an album, a favorite playlist--if it''s on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you can stream it to your home entertainment speakers via Apple TV. Because rocking out is always more fun in surround sound.</p>  <h5>Your speakers and AirPlay. Perfectly in tune.</h5> <p>Conduct a symphony, chill with an indie band, or put on a rock concert--anywhere in the house. Connect any speaker you own to an AirPort Express. Or stream directly to AirPlay-enabled speakers from manufacturers like Denon, Marantz, B&W, JBL, and iHome. Your iOS device automatically detects your speakers: Just tap the ones you want to use. Since it all happens wirelessly, you have the freedom to cue the tunes from wherever you happen to be sitting, standing, or dancing.</p>    <h4>Music. The DNA of iPod touch.</h4> <p>Your workouts, your cram sessions, your commute, your late-night dance party of one, your ever-present need to drown out the noise around you. It''s your music that keeps you going. And you know what respects that? iPod touch.</p>  <div class="rightImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-4.jpg" width="225" height="123" alt="iPod touch Cover Flow" />     <div class="imageCaption">Turn iPod touch on its side and glide through your music by album art with the flick of your finger. </div> </div>  <h5>A work of album art.</h5> <p>What a song does for your ears, Cover Flow on iPod touch does for your eyes and fingers. Turn iPod touch on its side and glide through your music by album art with the flick of your finger. Tap an album cover to flip it over and display a track list. Tap again to start the music.</p>  <h5>From one great song comes an even greater playlist.</h5> <p>Songs in your library get a newfound rhythm thanks to Genius. When you''re listening to a track you love and want to hear others that go great with it, let Genius take over. It finds complementary songs you own and makes a Genius playlist for you. Listen to the playlist right away, save it for later, or even refresh it and give it another go. Count on Genius to create a playlist you wouldn''t have thought of yourself.</p>  <h5>A genius of a mix.</h5> <p>Genius acts as your personal DJ. All you do is sync iPod touch to iTunes, and Genius automatically searches your library to find songs that sound great together. Then it creates multiple mixes you''ll love because it''s entirely your music. Genius Mixes are like stations tuned precisely to your taste. They''re a great way to rediscover songs you haven''t heard in forever--and some you forgot you had.</p>  <h5>Shake it like you mean it.</h5> <p>The next time you''re listening to your tunes, turn on Shake to Shuffle, then give iPod touch a shake to shuffle to a different song in your music library. It''s just another way iPod touch keeps your music feeling fresh.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-5.jpg" width="225" height="131" alt="iPod touch Games" />     <div class="imageCaption">It''s hard to be bored when you have instant access to over 500,000 apps, including the latest in gaming titles.</div> </div>  <h5>If it''s entertaining, it''s on iTunes.</h5> <p>Add songs and music videos to your iPod touch from iTunes on your computer.

And Chromebooks are designed to get faster over time as updates are released.</p> <h5>Find Your Next Favorite Web App</h5> <p>Every Chromebook runs millions of web apps, from games to spreadsheets to photo editors. Thanks to the power of HTML5, many apps keep working even in those rare moments when you''re not connected. To try the latest apps, visit the Chrome Web Store or just type in a URL. You can easily create shortcuts on your new tab page to launch your favorite web applications, so that you can enhance your online experience. No CDs required.</p> <h5>Simplicity in Sync</h5> <p>Chromebooks keep your apps, documents, favorites and settings safely in the cloud. That means you can login to a friend''s Chomebook and access your profile without disturbing theirs. Or, if you lose or break your Chromebook you have nothing to worry about. Just get another and login, you will be back up and running in minutes like nothing happened.</p> <h5>Forever Fresh</h5> <p>Your Chromebook gets better and better over time, unlike a traditional PC. When you turn it on, it updates itself. Automatically. All of your apps stay up-to-date, and you get the latest and greatest version of the operating system without having to think about it.

Either way, no one else using your Chromebook will have access to your email and personal data.</p> <h5>Built-in Security</h5> <p>Chromebooks run the first operating system designed from the ground up to defend against the ongoing threat of malware and viruses. They employ the principle of "defense in depth" to provide multiple layers of protection, including sandboxing, data encryption, and verified boot.

Imagine never missing a call and even turning your S5 into a speaker phone--with the S5, you don''t have to imagine, because it’s ready.<p> The built-in FM tuner will scan the entire FM range in less than 60 seconds and automatically place the available FM stations into presets. To eliminate stations with marginal reception, you can adjust the sensitivity to only preset stations with strong reception. The S5 comes with a built-in microphone so you can record live sound, such as an important lecture or your neighbor''s garage band, as an MP3 file. MPEG4 video files are the most common open video format available today, and the S5 comes ready to play MPEG 4 files right out of the box. Samsung multimedia software included with the S5 transcodes video files on your PC before transferring to the S5, so files on the S5 play at an optimal frame size and rate with minimal effort from the user.<p> Samsung multimedia software also can assist in transferring JPEG images onto the S5 for later viewing. Once on the S5, images can be zoomed and re-centered. Any JPEG on the S5 can become the wallpaper during music playback. For added user convenience, the S5 is compatible with music subscription services, such as Rhapsody, Napster, and Yahoo!. The player supports MP3, AAC, and WMA audio files, MPEG 4 video files, and JPEG photo files.

The state-of-the-art quad-core Intel i7 processor delivers up to 2x faster performance (over the previous generation of MacBook Pro). New Thunderbolt technology lets you connect high-performance peripherals and high-resolution displays to a single port, and transfer files at lightning speeds. And with the new built-in FaceTime HD camera, you can make astonishingly crisp HD video calls.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="179" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-angle_aper-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The 15.4-inch unibody MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt technology (see larger image).</div> </div> <p>With the revolutionary Thunderbolt technology, you''ll be able to achieve bi-directional channels with transfer speeds to peripherals like external hard drives and servers up to an amazing 10 Gbps--while also connecting to a DisplayPort-compatible high-resolution display.</p> <p>As with previous models, the MacBook Pro features a precision unibody enclosure crafted from a single block of aluminum, creating a thin and light mobile computing workhorse (less than 1 inch thin and just 5.6 pounds) that''s also highly durable. It includes a 15.4-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology. And it comes standard with automatic graphics switching that provides performance when you need it and energy efficiency when you don''t. You''ll also get up to 7 hours of battery life while on the go.</p> <p>This version of the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro (model MC721LL/A) features a 2.0 GHz Core i7 "Sandy Bridge" quad-core processor, 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include ultra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an SDXC card slot, two USB 2.0 ports, and a FireWire 800 port (see full specifications below). It also comes with the Mac OS X Lion operating system as well as the iLife software suite, which includes the latest versions of iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="201" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-frontface_osx-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">FaceTime HD camera built into the bezel for crisp, widescreen video chats (see larger image).</div> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="205" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings (see larger image).</div> </div> <h4>Key Features</h4> <h5>Revolutionary Thunderbolt Technology</h5> <p>Developed by Intel with collaboration from Apple, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O (input/output) technology delivers an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions. Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i7" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i7-sandy-120.jpg" width="120" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Quad-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor (dubbed "Sandy Bridge"), which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i7 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The "Sandy Bridge" Core i7 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 6 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 100px;"><img alt="AMD Radeon Graphics" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/amdbadge-2011-radeongraphics-sm.jpg" width="73" /></div> <h5>Automatic Graphics Switching</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro offers excellent graphics flexibility with two video processors--the discrete AMD Radeon HD 6490M processor (with 256 MB of GDDR5 video memory) for heavier workloads and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor for better battery life on the go. When gaming or using processor-intensive applications like Aperture or Final Cut Pro, you''ll appreciate the power of the AMD Radeon HD 6490M, which lets you see more frames per second and experience better responsiveness. And the automatic graphics switching feature determines which graphics processor an application needs and switches instantly between the processors.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between.

YP-K3 4GB MP3 Player with Photo Viewer- Black
Model: ypk3black

Condition: New 
Description:

Samsung''s YP-K3 4GB Audio Player is an ultra-thin subscription-enabled MP3 Player. Instead of being limited to one equalizer mode, like some other MP3 players, the K3 has five EQ modes so your music plays the way you want to hear it. 

Keeping with the "more than the usual player" mentality, Samsung includes above average headphones. These comfortable bass boosting earphones fit comfortably in your ear and substantially limit extraneous noise for an improved listening experience.

With an easy to browse picture menu, photo viewing capabilities and a built-in FM tuner, the K3 truly stands out among other flash-drive based MP3 players.

Samsung''s affordable 630 LCD HDTV series delivers Full HD resolution, playback of files from USB drives or over your home network from DLNA Certified devices, a wealth of HDMI inputs, and plenty more, all wrapped up in Samsungs eye-catching "Touch of Color" design.</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Samsung LN40D550" height="223" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/B004N866S0-1.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">An affordable 40-inch LCD panel with full HD resolution, DLNA/USB media playback, and other solid features.</div> </div> <h4>Crisp, Clear Picture Quality From a TV With a True Sense of Style</h4> <h5>1080p Full HD With Four HDMI Inputs</h5> <p>The LN40D630 delivers Full HD 1080p resolution, for a superb level of detail and clarity in your picture. To connect your sources, four separate HDMI inputs are provided, for delivering a Full HD picture and audio over a single cable.</p> <h5>Touch of Color Design</h5> <p>Samsungs "Touch of Color" design features a hint of amber color naturally blended into Samsungs traditional piano black bezel frame, for eye-catching style even when your TV is turned off.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 200px;"><img alt="Samsung LN40D550 DLNA" height="72" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/B004N85YEW-2.jpg" width="200" /> <div class="imageCaption">The LN40D630 lets you stream content directly from DLNA Certified devices (PCs, network storage, etc.) over your home network.</div> </div> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 200px;"><img alt="Samsung LN40D550 Touch of Color" height="133" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/B004N85YDI-3.jpg" width="200" /> <div class="imageCaption">Samsungs "Touch of Color" design features a hint of amber color naturally blended into Samsungs traditional piano black bezel frame.</div> </div> <h5>Exceeds ENERGY STAR Standards</h5> <p>The LN40D630 exceeds the strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA and US Department of Energy by up to 30%. That means you get lower utility costs, and a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <h5>ConnectShare Movie</h5> <p>Connect a thumb drive or digital camera quickly and easily via the LN40D630''s USB port. An intuitive, user-friendly interface allows access to videos, music, or pictures via the remote.</p> <p><strong>Auto Motion Plus 120Hz with Clear Motion Rate</strong></p> <p><br />Auto Motion Plus 120Hz brings action movies and sports to life in the living room, thanks to frame-to-frame smooth motion. This technology eliminates motion blur by calculating the image and inserting it, creating a non-repetitive transition from one frame to the next. Blur is virtually eliminated and clarity enhanced, for smooth, lifelike motion.</p> <h5>AllShare DLNA Networking</h5> <p>For even more entertainment options, the LN40D630 lets you connect to your home network and stream music, videos, and photos from other DLNA Certified devices (your computer, network storage drive, etc.).</p> <h5>Game Mode</h5> <p>The LN40D630 features a "game mode," which turns off much of the picture processing for a faster video response. This is ideal for fast-paced video sources like video game systems, and will help gamers get the performance they''re after.</p> <h5>Audio Performance</h5> <p>SRS'' TheaterSound, available in new Samsung HDTVs, is an all-in-one audio suite that directly addresses the three most common consumer TV audio complaints--inconsistent volume levels, unintelligible vocals, and poor, dimension-less sound. SRS helps ensure you get great audio from the LN40D630''s two 10-watt speakers, and additional technologies like Dolby Digital Plus and support for multi-channel sound (MTS) add even more on the sonic side of things.</p> <h5>PC Connectivity</h5> <p>The LN40D630 also features a PC input, so you an use it as a computer monitor.</p> <div class="break"></div> <h4>LN40D630 Select Specifications</h4> <table class="data" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <th colspan="2">Video</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Screen Size:</td> <td>40 Inches</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Display Type:</td> <td>CCFL-Backlit LCD</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Resolution:</td> <td>1080p Full HD</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2"><strong>Inputs</strong></th> </tr> <tr> <td>HDMI:</td> <td>4 (version 1.4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Component Video (Y/PB/PR):</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PC Input:</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>USB 2.0 Ports:</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Component Audio Input:</td> <td>2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PC Audio Input:</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2"><strong>Outputs</strong></th> </tr> <tr> <td>Digital Audio Output:</td> <td>1 (Rear)</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2">Weight and Dimensions</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Dimensions (WxHxD):</td> <td>39.1 x 24.1 x 3.2 Inches (39.1 x 26.3 x 10 Inches With Stand)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Weight:</td> <td>31.4 lbs.

It includes a 15.4-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology. And it comes standard with automatic graphics switching that provides performance when you need it and energy efficiency when you don''t. You''ll also get up to 7 hours of battery life while on the go.</p> <p>This version of the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro (model MD322LL/A) features a second-generation 2.4 GHz Core i7 quad-core processor, 750 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include ultra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an SDXC card slot, two USB 2.0 ports, and a FireWire 800 port (see full specifications below).</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="215" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q4-mbp-15-frontface-lion-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">FaceTime HD camera built into the bezel for crisp, widescreen video chats (see larger image).</div> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="205" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings (see larger image).</div> </div> <h4>OS X Lion</h4> <p>Every Mac comes with OS X Lion, the latest release of the world''s most advanced desktop operating system.

Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i7" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i7-sandy-120.jpg" width="120" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Quad-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i7 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The Core i7 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 6 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 100px;"><img alt="AMD Radeon Graphics" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/amdbadge-2011-radeongraphics-sm.jpg" width="73" /></div> <h5>Automatic Graphics Switching</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro offers excellent graphics flexibility with two video processors--the discrete AMD Radeon HD 6770M processor (with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory) for heavier workloads and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor for better battery life on the go. When gaming or using processor-intensive applications like Aperture or Final Cut Pro, you''ll appreciate the power of the AMD Radeon HD 6770M, which lets you see more frames per second and experience better responsiveness. And the automatic graphics switching feature determines which graphics processor an application needs and switches instantly between the processors.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe. And it also now supports inertial scrolling, an intuitive way to scroll through large photo libraries, lengthy documents and long web sites.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="72" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-closed-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="48" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-ports-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> </div> <a name="techspecs"> <h4>Key Specifications</h4> <ul> <li><strong>15.4-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display</strong> with edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass (1440 x 900-pixel resolution). </li> <li><strong>2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core processor</strong> with 6 MB shared L3 cache for excellent multitasking. </li> <li><strong>Dual graphics processors with automatic switching</strong> between AMD Radeon HD 6770M (with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory) for demanding applications and integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 (with 384 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory) for power savings. </li> <li><strong>750 GB Serial ATA hard drive</strong> (5400 RPM) </li> <li><strong>4 GB installed RAM</strong> (1333 MHz DDR3; supports up to 8 GB) </li> <li><strong>8x slot-loading SuperDrive</strong> with double-layer DVD support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW) </li> <li><strong>Built-in FaceTime HD camera</strong> for video chatting </li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi wireless networking</strong> (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible) </li> <li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet wired networking</strong> (10/100/1000) </li> <li><strong>Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</strong> for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones </li> <li><strong>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 800 port</strong> </li> <li><strong>SDXC card slot</strong> </li> <li><strong>Thunderbolt port</strong> with native Mini DisplayPort output plus support for DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI, and HDMI (requires adapters, sold separately) </li> <li><strong>Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control</strong> with support for inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities </li> <li><strong>Full-size backlit keyboard</strong> </li> <li><strong>Stereo speakers with subwoofers</strong> </li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 14.35 x 9.82 x 0.95 inches (WxDxH) </li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 5.6 pounds </li> <li><strong>Up to 7 hours of battery life</strong> </li> <li><strong>Meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements</strong> </li> <li><strong>Rated EPEAT Gold</strong> </li> </ul> <h5>What''s in the Box</h5> <p>15.4-inch MacBook Pro, display cleaning cloth, 85W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, power cord, printed and electronic documentation</p> <h5>Limited Warranty And Service</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty, which can be extended to 3 years with the AppleCare Protection Plan.</p> <h4>Installed Software</h4> <p>At the heart of every MacBook Pro--and every Mac--is OS X Lion, an operating system that''s both easy to use and incredibly powerful.

Motionflow 120Hz technology doubles the frame rate from the standard 60 frames per second and applies Image Blur Reduction technology to deliver a crisp, fluid and realistic viewing experience during fast-action scenes.</p>  <p><strong>LightSensor Technology:</strong> Automatically increase or decrease the level of brightness of your TV''s backlight based on a room''s lighting conditions with the integrated LightSensor technology. Dim the lights to watch a movie and the sensor dims the backlight, which also helps reduce unnecessary power consumption.</p>  <p><strong>Ambient Sensor:</strong> Get a natural looking picture whether you are watching movies late at night or playing video games during the day with an Ambient Sensor that automatically adjusts the picture color based on a room''s lighting.</p>  <p><strong>BRAVIA Engine 2:</strong> Enjoy sharp, vibrant, life-like images while optimizing color and contrast and significantly reducing noise with the BRAVIA Engine 2 fully digital processor.</p>  <p><strong>6 HD Inputs:</strong> Get versatile HD connection options with 6 HD inputs, including 4 HDMI inputs to connect a Blu-ray Disc player, PlayStation3 gaming console or any other HDMI-capable equipment. Two HD component inputs provide added HD-capable connectivity, while a PC input (HD-15 pin) lets you use your HDTV as a computer monitor.</p>  <p><strong>24p True Cinema:</strong> Movies consist of 24 images per second, and cannot be faithfully reproduced on conventional televisions, resulting in unnatural, jerky movements. But 24p True Cinema displays the 24 progressive images as they should be, in the same sequence as the original film source. Now, you can recreate the visual clarity of cinema-quality movies in the comfort of your own home.</p>  <p><strong>USB Input:</strong> Share your photos on the big screen or listen to your favorite music.

So with HDTVs, the rule tends to be you can sit anywhere from 1.5 to 3 times the screen size (in inches) for the best experience.  <p> If you know the size of the room you have already, where you want to sit, and where your new HDTV should go once you get it, you can figure out the size HDTV you should get.  <ul>  <li>Minimum size = Viewing distance/3</li>  <li>Maximum size=Viewing

It''s what makes that racing game feel so real. It''s why you''re able to tweet what you just overheard in the cafe. And it''s the reason iPod touch is the most amazing iPod you''ll ever own. <p><strong>Multi-Touch</strong><br /> The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, zoom in and out on a section of a web page, and control game elements precisely.</p> <p><strong>Accelerometer</strong><br /> The accelerometer inside iPod touch allows it to detect when you rotate iPod touch from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display. The accelerometer really shines when you play games, because it immerses you in the action.

That means you can get online anywhere there''s Wi-Fi. Send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Shop for games from your couch. Browse, buy, and download music and more from the iTunes Store. iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks. If you''ve never used a particular network, Wireless Icon it asks you to enter a password the first time, and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you''re within range, it connects automatically.</p> <p><strong>Bluetooth</strong><br /> Bluetooth is a form of wireless technology that lets you use devices without the hassle of cables or wires. What does that mean for iPod touch? It means you can use iPod touch with Bluetooth headphones and listen to your music no matter where in the room your iPod touch is. So lounge on your bed, while your iPod touch charges on your desk. Bluetooth on iPod touch is also great for peer-to-peer gaming.</p> <p><strong>Design</strong><br /> iPod touch is as remarkable outside as it is inside. Holding one is all the proof you need.

Its patented unibody enclosure is the product of precise machining.  The new energy-efficient architecture in the MacBook Pro, gives you dramatically longer battery life. On a single charge, the battery in the new 13-inch MacBook Pro lasts up to 10 hours, and you’ll get up to 1000 full charge and discharge cycles — that’s nearly three times the lifespan of typical notebook batteries.    MacBook Pro gives you more options for high-performance graphics, starting with the new NVIDIA GeForce 320M integrated graphics processor in the 13-inch model. It’s up to 80 percent faster than the previous generation and is even more energy-efficient for everyday tasks like writing email and surfing the web.  Every MacBook Pro has a pristine LED-backlit display with wide-angle viewing and a color gamut usually seen only on a desktop display. So whether you’re watching a movie or making one, you’ve got the perfect canvas. The ultrathin, seamless glass enclosure makes the display strong and durable. And because it’s power efficient and free of mercury and arsenic, this display is greener than ever.  The 13-Inch MacBook Pro has advanced Intel Core 2 Duo processors.

As beautiful as it is wearable.</h2> <p><strong>Sleek, polished aluminum. Five brilliant colors.</strong><br /> Its main body is crafted from a single piece of aluminum and polished to a beautiful shine, so the new iPod shuffle feels solid, sleek, and durable. And the color palette makes it the perfect fashion accessory. Choose gleaming silver, blue, green, orange, or pink.</p> <p><strong>Hundreds of songs to go</strong><br /> Never leave a favorite tune behind. Along with up to 15 hours of battery life, iPod shuffle gives you 2 GB of storage capacity, good for hundreds of songs. That''s plenty of room for the essential songs for your workout or commute. And for multiple playlists, Genius Mixes, podcasts, and audiobooks.</p> <p><strong>Goes anywhere. And with anything.</strong><br /> iPod shuffle isn''t just portable. It''s wearable, too. Clip it to your shirt, jacket, workout gear, backpack, or purse strap, and it stays put--whether you''re running an errand or running around the track.</p> <h2>Controls. Right on the button.</h2> <p><strong>Control your music with just a click</strong><br /> It''s back--the big, clickable control pad on the front of iPod shuffle. It''s 18 percent larger than on previous iPod shuffle models, so it''s even easier to see and use the music controls. Press the center button to play and pause. Press the outer buttons to skip forward or back and adjust volume. Click, click, click. It''s music to your fingers.</p> <p><strong>Play it your way</strong><br /> Maybe you''re the spontaneous type. Or maybe you prefer a little order. Just flip the shuffle switch to suit your listening style. Flip it to the left, and you''ll hear your music in a refreshingly random way. Flip it to the middle, and your songs play in order. Or flip to the right to turn iPod shuffle off.</p> <h2>VoiceOver. It tells you what you want to hear.</h2> <p><strong>Give your songs a voice</strong><br /> Say you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist. Just press the new VoiceOver button on top of your iPod shuffle, and it tells you. You can even use VoiceOver to hear the names of playlists and switch between them. And if your battery needs charging, VoiceOver tells you that, too.</p> <p><strong>It speaks your language</strong><br /> A French love song. A Spanish bolero. An Italian cantata. Your music library has songs from all over the world. That''s why VoiceOver speaks 25 different languages. So it can tell you song titles and artists in their native tongues or any language you choose.</p> <h2>Playlists. The perfect mix for every mood.</h2> <p><strong>Sync to your heart''s content</strong><br /> iTunes on your Mac or PC makes it easy to load up your iPod shuffle. Just choose the playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio files you want, then sync.</p> <p><strong>When one playlist isn''t enough</strong><br /> You probably have multiple playlists in iTunes on your computer. One for your commute. One for the gym. One for just relaxing. Sync all those playlists to iPod shuffle, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever mood strikes you. VoiceOver tells you the name of each playlist, so it''s easy to switch between them and find the one you want without looking.</p> <p><strong>Genius comes to iPod shuffle</strong><br /> There''s another way to get a good mix of music on iPod shuffle: let Genius do the work. Activate Genius in iTunes on your computer, and it automatically finds songs that sound great together. Then it creates Genius Mixes, which you can easily sync to your iPod shuffle. It''s the perfect way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in, like, forever.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box?</h2> <p>2 GB iPod shuffle (silver), Apple earphones, iPod shuffle USB cable (45 mm), quick start guide, and other important product information.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b001fa1nuk',N'20120319 22:00:40.470',N'20120319 22:00:40.470',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Oh, I see what you''re saying.</h4> <p>Video calling on iPod touch means your friends can see what you''re up to, when you''re up to it. With a tap, you can call someone on an iPhone, iPad 2, iPod touch, or Mac over Wi-Fi. And come face-to-face with even more fun.</p>  <h5>Tap for a more instant, instant message.</h5> <p>Take "LOL" to the next level and actually see friends laughing. Or bring "XOXO" to life when you blow someone a kiss from miles away. FaceTime on iPod touch makes it possible. FaceTime works right out of the box--just enter your Apple ID and email address. Or create a new email account just for FaceTime. Using FaceTime is as easy as it gets. Say you want to start a video call with your best friend over Wi-Fi. Just tap the FaceTime app and find her entry to start the call. An invitation pops up on her screen asking if she wants to join you. When she accepts, FaceTime begins. It''s all perfectly seamless. And it works in both portrait and landscape. See how much fun you can have.</p>  <h5>Two cameras make either side its fun side.</h5> <p>iPod touch has two built-in cameras, one on the front above the display and one on the back. The front camera has been tuned for FaceTime. It has just the right field of view and focal length to focus on your face at arm''s length. So it always presents you in the best possible light. Which is especially handy when you''re talking to someone who''s more than just a friend.</p>  <h5>The back camera. See and share.</h5> <p>So your friend is sick with a cold and can''t make it to the concert. You can share the encore with a FaceTime call. As the band takes the stage and starts playing one of her all-time favorite songs, just tap a button. And before the lead singer can belt out his first note, iPod touch switches to the back camera and to the sure-to-be-legendary performance. Another tap switches to the front camera and to you. Simple, fast, and fun.</p>  <h4>Camera with HD Video Recording. Ready, and action.</h4> <p>The next great Internet meme could be yours. iPod touch and its HD video camera go with you everywhere, so you can capture every "What the?" moment that comes your way.</p>  <h5>Trim a little off the ends. Or the middle.</h5> <p>No need to wait until you''re back at your computer to edit video. With basic editing built into iPod touch, you can get right down to business. Just drag to select start and end points on a filmstrip. Keep only the parts of the video you want, and turn it into something you and your friends will watch again and again.</p>   <div class="rightImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-2.jpg" width="225" height="124" alt="iPod touch Camera" />     <div class="imageCaption">iPod touch features a second camera on the back, which lets you shoot amazing 720p HD video. </div> </div>    <h5>Special guest star: iMovie.</h5> <p>You''re on an epic road trip, and you want to create a video postcard of everything you''ve seen and done. Just use the iMovie app--pick it up on the App Store for just $4.99. Built for Multi-Touch, iMovie lets you combine and edit video clips, give them that extra something with dynamic themes, add music and photos, and share your finished movies with the world.</p>  <h5>This is so going on YouTube.</h5> <p>Maybe you''re in the middle of texting a friend or browsing the web when you look up and suddenly see something that words just can''t describe. Launch the camera and record on the fly. Then upload your HD movie directly to YouTube. Or select some video from the Camera Roll and attach it to a new email message, ready to send. Posting to your Facebook page or blog is also just a tap away.</p>  <h5>Two cameras. Countless photo ops.</h5> <p>A really cool piece of graffiti art. A cupcake too cute to eat. Your cat camouflaged by stuffed animals. If you want to take a quick photo to post on Twitter, either camera on iPod touch can also capture stills. Use grid lines, pinch-to-zoom gestures, and single-tap exposure lock to compose the perfect shot. Then tap to tweet at will.</p>     <h4>Retina Display. Seeing is still not believing.</h4> <p>Thanks to the Retina display, everything you see and do on iPod touch looks amazing. That''s because the Retina display''s pixel density is so high your eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels. Which means images in games, movies, and photos pop off the screen. Text in books, web pages, and email is crisp at any size. And everything is sharper. No wonder it''s called "cutting edge."</p>   <div class="leftImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-3.jpg" width="150" height="261" alt="iPod touch Music" />     <div class="imageCaption">When iPod came on the scene years ago, it was all about music--and it still is. Enjoy your favorite tunes, whether it''s on headphones or wirelessly over AirPlay. </div> </div>   <h5>More wow per inch.</h5> <p>Behind the screen of iPod touch, there''s some serious technology going on. By developing pixels a mere 78 micrometers wide, Apple engineers were able to pack four times the number of pixels into the same size screen found on earlier iPod touch models. This many pixels packed this close together--326 per inch--make graphics and text look smooth and continuous at any size. Prepare to be glued to the screen.</p>  <h5>LED backlighting.</h5> <p>The Retina display includes LED backlighting and an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen for the best viewing and battery life possible. So you can focus on more important things. Like destroying aliens.</p>    <h4>AirPlay. Broadcast live to your HDTV and speakers.</h4> <p>With AirPlay, you can wirelessly stream what''s on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your HDTV and speakers via Apple TV. That''s gonna go over big.</p>  <h5>Give your photos and video the big-screen treatment.</h5> <p>You have great photos on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch and some friends on your couch. Or you''re in the middle of an epic action scene that could use a little more screen. Tap the AirPlay icon on your iOS 5 device from a specific app--Photos, Videos, or Safari, for example--and everything streams to your HDTV via your Apple TV.* Make sure both your device and Apple TV are connected to the same Wi-Fi network, and the AirPlay icon appears automatically.</p>  <h5>DJ wirelessly.</h5> <p>AirPlay isn''t just for photos, movies, and apps. It''s for your music, too. A song, an album, a favorite playlist--if it''s on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you can stream it to your home entertainment speakers via Apple TV. Because rocking out is always more fun in surround sound.</p>  <h5>Your speakers and AirPlay. Perfectly in tune.</h5> <p>Conduct a symphony, chill with an indie band, or put on a rock concert--anywhere in the house. Connect any speaker you own to an AirPort Express. Or stream directly to AirPlay-enabled speakers from manufacturers like Denon, Marantz, B&W, JBL, and iHome. Your iOS device automatically detects your speakers: Just tap the ones you want to use. Since it all happens wirelessly, you have the freedom to cue the tunes from wherever you happen to be sitting, standing, or dancing.</p>    <h4>Music. The DNA of iPod touch.</h4> <p>Your workouts, your cram sessions, your commute, your late-night dance party of one, your ever-present need to drown out the noise around you. It''s your music that keeps you going. And you know what respects that? iPod touch.</p>  <div class="rightImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-4.jpg" width="225" height="123" alt="iPod touch Cover Flow" />     <div class="imageCaption">Turn iPod touch on its side and glide through your music by album art with the flick of your finger. </div> </div>  <h5>A work of album art.</h5> <p>What a song does for your ears, Cover Flow on iPod touch does for your eyes and fingers. Turn iPod touch on its side and glide through your music by album art with the flick of your finger. Tap an album cover to flip it over and display a track list. Tap again to start the music.</p>  <h5>From one great song comes an even greater playlist.</h5> <p>Songs in your library get a newfound rhythm thanks to Genius. When you''re listening to a track you love and want to hear others that go great with it, let Genius take over. It finds complementary songs you own and makes a Genius playlist for you. Listen to the playlist right away, save it for later, or even refresh it and give it another go. Count on Genius to create a playlist you wouldn''t have thought of yourself.</p>  <h5>A genius of a mix.</h5> <p>Genius acts as your personal DJ. All you do is sync iPod touch to iTunes, and Genius automatically searches your library to find songs that sound great together. Then it creates multiple mixes you''ll love because it''s entirely your music. Genius Mixes are like stations tuned precisely to your taste. They''re a great way to rediscover songs you haven''t heard in forever--and some you forgot you had.</p>  <h5>Shake it like you mean it.</h5> <p>The next time you''re listening to your tunes, turn on Shake to Shuffle, then give iPod touch a shake to shuffle to a different song in your music library. It''s just another way iPod touch keeps your music feeling fresh.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:250px">     <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page-2/B001FA1O0O-5.jpg" width="225" height="131" alt="iPod touch Games" />     <div class="imageCaption">It''s hard to be bored when you have instant access to over 500,000 apps, including the latest in gaming titles.</div> </div>  <h5>If it''s entertaining, it''s on iTunes.</h5> <p>Add songs and music videos to your iPod touch from iTunes on your computer.

Available in almost every category, they''re just a tap away at the App Store. And when it comes to games and entertainment titles--over 100,000 and counting--no other platform comes close to iPod touch.

And the built-in battery lasts up to 10 hours.</p>  <div class="rightImage" style="width:400px"> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-macbookpro-13-q410-hero-sm.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="13-inch MacBook Pro" /><div class="imageCaption">The 13-inch unibody MacBook Pro (see larger image).</div> </div>  <p>As with previous models, the new MacBook Pro features a precision unibody enclosure crafted from a single block of aluminum, creating a thin and light mobile computing workhorse (less than 1 inch thin and just 4.5 pounds) that''s also highly durable. And it includes a 13.3-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology.</p>  <p>This version of the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro (model MC374LL/A) features a 2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 250 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include integrated Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an SD card slot, and two USB 2.0 ports (see full specifications below). It also comes with the Mac OS X Snow Leopard operating system as well as the iLife software suite, which includes the latest versions of iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand. </p>  <h4>Key Features</h4>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:400px"> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-macbookpro-13-q410-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" height="208" alt="13-inch MacBook Pro" /><div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings<br>(see larger image).</div> </div>  <h5>Intel Core 2 Duo Processing</h5> <p>Combining fast processing speeds with power-saving features, the Intel Core 2 Duo processor provides greater multitasking performance by combining two independent processor cores while also reducing power requirements and saving on battery life. This Intel Core 2 Duo processor has a 2.4 GHz processor speed, speedy 1066 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)</p>  <h5>High Performance Graphics</h5> <p>Powered by the NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics card, the Mac mini allows you to view flawless video in full screen HD and play the latest games with fast frame rate. It''s a great match to editing video masterpieces with iMovie and managing your photos in iPhoto, and it comes with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM that''s shared with main memory.</p>  <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe. And it also now supports inertial scrolling, an intuitive way to scroll through large photo libraries, lengthy documents and long web sites. </p>  <a name="techspecs"><h4>Key Specifications</h4> <ul> <li><strong>13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display</strong> with edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass (1280 x 800-pixel resolution). <strong><li>2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo dual-core processor</strong> with 3 MB shared L2 cache for excellent multitasking <li><strong>NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics processor</strong> with 256 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory. <li><strong>250 GB Serial ATA hard drive</strong> (5400 RPM)  <li><strong>4 GB installed RAM</strong> (1066 MHz DDR3; supports up to 8 GB)  <li><strong>8x slot-loading SuperDrive</strong> with double-layer DVD support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)  <div class="rightImage" style="width:400px"> <p> </p>  <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-macbookpro-13-q410-side-left-sm.jpg" width="400" height="62" alt="13-inch MacBook Pro" /><div class="imageCaption">The left (above) and right (below) sides of the MacBook Pro (see larger image).</div>  <p> </p>  <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-macbookpro-13-q410-side-right-sm.jpg" width="400" height="59" alt="13-inch MacBook Pro" /> </div>  <li><strong>Built-in iSight camera</strong> for video chatting <li><strong>Wi-Fi wireless networking</strong> (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible) <li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet wired networking</strong> (10/100/1000)  <li><strong>Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</strong> for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones <li><strong>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 800 port</strong> <li><strong>SD card slot</strong> <li><strong>Mini DisplayPort video output</strong> with optional adapters for DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI, and HDMI output <li><strong>Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control</strong> with support for inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities <li><strong>Full-size backlit keyboard</strong> <li><strong>Stereo speakers with subwoofers</strong> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12.78 x 8.94 x 0.95 inches (WxDxH) <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.5 pounds <li><strong>Up to 10 hours of battery life</strong> <li><strong>Meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements</strong> </ul>   <h5>What''s in the Box</h5>  <p>MacBook Pro, display cleaning cloth, 60W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, power cord, software DVDs, printed and electronic documentation</p>  <h5>Limited Warranty And Service</h5>    <p>The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty, which can be extended to 3 years with the AppleCare Protection Plan.</p>  <h4>Installed software</h4> <p>Mac OS X Snow Leopard is an even more powerful and refined version of the world''s most advanced operating system.

For more song combinations you wouldn''t have thought of yourself, create Genius Mixes in iTunes and sync the ones you like to your iPod nano. Then tap the Genius Mixes icon and rediscover songs you haven''t heard in a while--or find music you forgot you even had.</p> <h2>FM radio.

Meet your new personal trainer.</h2> <p><strong>Clip and go. And go. And go.</strong><br /> The new iPod nano design actually helps keep you fit. It''s portable and wearable, which makes it runnable, walkable, and workout-able. Clip it on and control your music with just a tap or swipe of a finger, so you can stay focused without fumbling around. For your run, walk, or trip to the gym, a little iPod nano goes a long way.</p> <p><strong>Stay fit with every step.</strong><br /> iPod nano doubles as a pedometer, which makes it the ideal exercise partner. It keeps track of your steps and helps you meet your fitness goals. Just clip it on and walk on. You can create a daily step goal and check your progress when you upload all your data to the Nike+ website.</p>  <p><strong>Rock your workout. </strong><br /> With the Nike + iPod Sport Kit (sold separately), iPod nano keeps you motivated from warm-up to cooldown on your run or in the gym. Lace up a pair of Nike+ running shoes and clip on your iPod nano. You''ll watch the miles unfold and hear real-time voice feedback along with your favorite songs. In the gym, connect iPod nano to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio machine. It records your pace, time, and distance as you work out and rock out.</p> <h2>iTunes. For your iPod-playing pleasure.</h2> <p><strong>Everything you need to be entertained.</strong><br /> iTunes is the best way to fill your iPod nano with the latest music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more.

Everything you buy on the iTunes Store--and any music from CDs you import--appears in your iTunes library. You can make your own playlists, create Genius playlists, choose Genius Mixes, and sync it all to your iPod nano. And you can download iTunes free.</p> <p><strong>The world''s #1 music store.</strong><br /> Load your iPod nano with your favorite tunes. Or browse over 13 million songs and discover even more. You can search by artist name, song, or album title and handpick exactly the songs you want. Want some help finding new music? The Genius sidebar recommends new music based on the songs you already love. When you find something that sparks your interest, listen to the free 30-second preview. Click once to buy the song and it starts downloading instantly. It''s the fastest, easiest way to build a digital music collection for your iPod nano.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p><strong>Built-in accessibility.</strong><br /> iPod nano comes with accessibility features that help people with disabilities enjoy music, audiobooks, and more.</p> <p><strong>VoiceOver</strong><br /> iPod nano features VoiceOver, the world''s first gesture-based screen reader. Touch the screen to hear a description of the item under your finger, then double-tap, drag, or flick to control iPod nano. Use the optional Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic to control your music without looking at the screen. VoiceOver tells you the name of the song or artist--and it speaks 29 languages.</p> <p><strong>White on Black</strong><br /> If you prefer higher contrast, iPod nano lets you change the display to white on black. Use the White on Black feature in any application, as well as on the Home screen.</p>  <p><strong>Mono Audio</strong><br /> If your hearing is limited in one ear, turn on Mono Audio to route audio into both earbuds so you can hear both channels in either ear.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box</h2> <p>8GB iPod nano (Blue), Apple Earphones, Dock Connector to USB Cable, Quick Start Guide and Important Product Information</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b002l6heau',N'20120319 22:00:50.453',N'20120319 22:00:50.453',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

Samsung''s ConnectShare Movie technology lets you plug in a thumb drive or other USB device and play media files using your remote to control it all. When it''s time for movie titles and TV programming, the UN19D4003 delivers a clear and captivating picture in 720p HD resolution. Even when it''s off, it''s easy on the eye, with an ultra-thin bezel, and a sleek form factor.</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Samsung UN19D4003" height="310" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/samsung/B004VRJ3E2.PT01.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">Watch your favorite movies--and memories--with incredible LED picture quality on a 19-inch HDTV.</div> </div> <h4>Makes Sharing Memories as Easy as Watching Movies</h4> <h5>Slim and Stylish LED HDTV</h5> <p>LED backlighting is not only more energy-efficient than its CCFL counterpart, it allows for a slimmer television design, allowing the UN19D4003 to check in at just over an inch deep without its stand. Samsung''s ultra-thin bezel design adds to the visual appeal, making this display almost all screen, and a worthy addition to most any room.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 200px;"><img alt="Samsung UN32D4000 ConnectShare" height="100" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/B004N867AM-2.jpg" width="200" /> <div class="imageCaption">Samsung''s ConnectShare lets you easily connect a thumb drive or digital camera via USB and enjoy videos, music, or picture files.</div> </div> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 200px;"><img alt="Samsung UN32D4000 Wide Color Enhancer Plus" height="121" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/B004N867AM-3.jpg" width="200" /> <div class="imageCaption">Wide Color Enhancer Plus delivers the entire spectrum of color and luminance for rich, saturated images with intense detail.</div> </div> <h5>Exceeds ENERGY STAR Standards</h5> <p>The UN19D4003 taps into the energy efficiency of LED backlighting, and exceeds the strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the EPA and US Department of Energy by up to 50%. That means you get lower utility costs, and a smaller carbon footprint.</p> <h5>Wide Color Enhancer Plus</h5> <p>The challenge of any TV screen is to recreate reality through color and light. Samsung takes on this challenge with their Wide Color Enhancer Pro feature. After analyzing each pixel, it stretches them to their 3-dimensional limit. What you get is the entire spectrum of color and luminance for rich, saturated images with intense detail.</p> <h5>Audio Performance</h5> <p>SRS'' TheaterSound, available in new Samsung HDTVs, is an all-in-one audio suite that directly addresses the three most common consumer TV audio complaints--inconsistent volume levels, unintelligible vocals, and poor, dimension-less sound. SRS helps ensure you get the most out of the UN19D4003''s two 5-watt speakers, and additional technologies like Dolby Digital Plus and support for multi-channel sound (MTS) add even more on the sonic side of things.</p> <div class="break"></div> <h4>UN19D4003 Select Specifications</h4> <table class="data" width="100%"> <tbody> <tr> <th colspan="2">Video</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Screen Size:</td> <td>18.5 Inches</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Display Type:</td> <td>LED</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Resolution:</td> <td>720p</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tuner :</td> <td>ATSC / Clear QAM</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2"><strong>Inputs</strong></th> </tr> <tr> <td>HDMI:</td> <td>1 (version 1.4)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Component Video (Y/PB/PR):</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PC Input:</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>USB 2.0 Ports:</td> <td>1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Component Audio Input:</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PC Audio Input:</td> <td>0</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2"><strong>Outputs</strong></th> </tr> <tr> <td>Digital Audio Output:</td> <td>1 (Rear)</td> </tr> <tr> <th colspan="2">Weight and Dimensions</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Dimensions (WxHxD):</td> <td>17.6" x 10.9" x 1.6" Inches (17.6" x 12.3" x 4.9" Inches With Stand)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Weight:</td> <td>6.2 lbs.

As beautiful as it is wearable.</h2> <p><strong>Sleek, polished aluminum. Five brilliant colors.</strong><br /> Its main body is crafted from a single piece of aluminum and polished to a beautiful shine, so the new iPod shuffle feels solid, sleek, and durable. And the color palette makes it the perfect fashion accessory. Choose gleaming silver, blue, green, orange, or pink.</p> <p><strong>Hundreds of songs to go</strong><br /> Never leave a favorite tune behind. Along with up to 15 hours of battery life, iPod shuffle gives you 2 GB of storage capacity, good for hundreds of songs. That''s plenty of room for the essential songs for your workout or commute. And for multiple playlists, Genius Mixes, podcasts, and audiobooks.</p> <p><strong>Goes anywhere. And with anything.</strong><br /> iPod shuffle isn''t just portable. It''s wearable, too. Clip it to your shirt, jacket, workout gear, backpack, or purse strap, and it stays put--whether you''re running an errand or running around the track.</p> <h2>Controls. Right on the button.</h2> <p><strong>Control your music with just a click</strong><br /> It''s back--the big, clickable control pad on the front of iPod shuffle. It''s 18 percent larger than on previous iPod shuffle models, so it''s even easier to see and use the music controls. Press the center button to play and pause. Press the outer buttons to skip forward or back and adjust volume. Click, click, click. It''s music to your fingers.</p> <p><strong>Play it your way</strong><br /> Maybe you''re the spontaneous type. Or maybe you prefer a little order. Just flip the shuffle switch to suit your listening style. Flip it to the left, and you''ll hear your music in a refreshingly random way. Flip it to the middle, and your songs play in order. Or flip to the right to turn iPod shuffle off.</p> <h2>VoiceOver. It tells you what you want to hear.</h2> <p><strong>Give your songs a voice</strong><br /> Say you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist. Just press the new VoiceOver button on top of your iPod shuffle, and it tells you. You can even use VoiceOver to hear the names of playlists and switch between them. And if your battery needs charging, VoiceOver tells you that, too.</p> <p><strong>It speaks your language</strong><br /> A French love song. A Spanish bolero. An Italian cantata. Your music library has songs from all over the world. That''s why VoiceOver speaks 25 different languages. So it can tell you song titles and artists in their native tongues or any language you choose.</p> <h2>Playlists. The perfect mix for every mood.</h2> <p><strong>Sync to your heart''s content</strong><br /> iTunes on your Mac or PC makes it easy to load up your iPod shuffle. Just choose the playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio files you want, then sync.</p> <p><strong>When one playlist isn''t enough</strong><br /> You probably have multiple playlists in iTunes on your computer. One for your commute. One for the gym. One for just relaxing. Sync all those playlists to iPod shuffle, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever mood strikes you. VoiceOver tells you the name of each playlist, so it''s easy to switch between them and find the one you want without looking.</p> <p><strong>Genius comes to iPod shuffle</strong><br /> There''s another way to get a good mix of music on iPod shuffle: let Genius do the work. Activate Genius in iTunes on your computer, and it automatically finds songs that sound great together. Then it creates Genius Mixes, which you can easily sync to your iPod shuffle. It''s the perfect way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in, like, forever.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box?</h2> <p>2 GB iPod shuffle (orange), Apple earphones, iPod shuffle USB cable (45 mm), quick start guide, and other important product information.</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b001fa1nw8',N'20120319 22:00:44.543',N'20120319 22:00:44.543',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

A durable polycarbonate shell in white keeps it ready for the rough and tumble of everyday life. It also offers a unique keyboard design that sits flush against the bed for a sleeker, lower profile. Other standard Apple "extras" includes a built-in iSight video camera and Apple''s magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter, which safely disconnects when under strain. <p> It''s pre-loaded with Apple''s Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system, which enables easy backup of your most important data via Time Machine, a redesigned desktop that helps eliminate clutter.

As an added nicety, this means less wear on the connectors. <p> Cleverly integrated above your MacBook display is an iSight camera, providing easy video chat capability when using iChat. You can also snap photos in Photo Booth to send via e-mail, as well as record videos and then edit them in iMovie before uploading them to web sites. <p> The trackpad can tell if you''ve got one finger on the pedal, or two. With two, you can easily scroll around your documents or open contextual menus. When you need right-click functionality, simply open "Keyboard and Mouse" in System Preferences and enable the secondary click preference. Opening and closing your MacBook is also a pleasure, thanks to a magnetic latch that catches without a catch. And because it''s a magnet, there are no moving parts to snag, jam, or break.  <p> <b>Intel Core 2 Duo Processor</b><br> Experience improved energy efficiency, expanded wireless connectivity, and amazing battery life with the 45nm Penryn series Intel Core 2 Duo T8100 processor, which has a 2.10 GHz processor speed, super-fast 800 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and a large 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.) <p> The new hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--conserves even more energy, giving you more time away from the wall outlet. With a substantial 3 MB of shared L2 cache, data and instructions can be kept close to the two processor cores, greatly increasing performance and allowing the entire system to work more efficiently. And, because the processor cores share the L2 cache, either can use the entire amount if the other happens to be idle.  <p> <b>Hard Drive and Memory</b><br> The 120 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (5400 RPM) quickens the pace with a higher speed transfer of data--akin to FireWire and USB 2.0.

It works seamlessly with the new AirPort Extreme with 802.11n. Use the built-in Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to your PDA or cell phone, synchronize addresses, or download pictures from your cell phone. You can also use a wireless headset for iChat audio chats and VoIP calls as well as quickly share files with a colleague.  <p> <b>Display and Graphics</b><br> Whether you''re working on a Keynote presentation or watching a movie before you catch a flight, every document, video, and photo on your MacBook will look sharp on the glossy 13.3-inch widescreen display. With pixel-perfect 1280-by-800 resolution, it''s great for viewing and working with media. Video is powered by the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100, which provides 144 MB of DDR2 SDRAM shared with main memory. It features Intel Clear Video Technology, which delivers outstanding video playback with sharper image quality, increased clarity, and enhanced visual quality of interlaced content on progressive displays.  <p> <b>Video Conferencing with Built-in iSight</b><br> Artfully placed in the display bezel is an iSight camera, which enables easy video conferencing as well as allows you to snap pictures of yourself and create video podcasts. Using the iChat AV application, video conferencing is integrated into your iChat buddy list, so initiating a video conference is a breeze. iChat also lets you hold audio chats with up to 10 people and provides high-quality audio compression and full-duplex sound so conversation can flow naturally.

New Thunderbolt technology lets you connect high-performance peripherals and high-resolution displays to a single port, and transfer files at lightning speeds. And with the built-in FaceTime HD camera, you can make astonishingly crisp HD video calls.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 17-inch MacBook Pro" height="182" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q4-mbp-17-angle-lion-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The 17-inch unibody MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt technology (see larger image).</div> </div> <p>With the revolutionary Thunderbolt technology, you''ll be able to achieve bi-directional channels with transfer speeds to peripherals like external hard drives and servers up to an amazing 10 Gbps--while also connecting to a DisplayPort-compatible high-resolution display.</p> <p>As with previous models, the MacBook Pro features a precision unibody enclosure crafted from a single block of aluminum, creating a thin and light mobile computing workhorse (less than 1 inch thin and just 6.6 pounds) that''s also highly durable. It includes a 17-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology. And it comes standard with automatic graphics switching that provides performance when you need it and energy efficiency when you don''t. You''ll also get up to 7 hours of battery life while on the go.</p> <p>This version of the 17-inch MacBook Pro (model MD311LL/A) features a second-generation 2.4 GHz Core i7 quad-core processor, 750 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include ultra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an ExpressCard/34 slot, three USB 2.0 ports, and a FireWire 800 port (see full specifications below).</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 17-inch MacBook Pro" height="194" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-17-frontface_fcp-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">FaceTime HD camera built into the bezel for crisp, widescreen video chats (see larger image).</div> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 17-inch MacBook Pro" height="193" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-17-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings (see larger image).</div> </div> <h4>Key Features</h4> <h5>Revolutionary Thunderbolt Technology</h5> <p>Developed by Intel with collaboration from Apple, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O (input/output) technology delivers an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions. Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i7" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i7-sandy-120.jpg" width="120" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Quad-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i7 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The Core i7 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 6 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 100px;"><img alt="AMD Radeon Graphics" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/amdbadge-2011-radeongraphics-sm.jpg" width="73" /></div> <h5>Automatic Graphics Switching</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro offers excellent graphics flexibility with two video processors--the discrete AMD Radeon HD 6770M processor (with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory) for heavier workloads and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor for better battery life on the go. When gaming or using processor-intensive applications like Aperture or Final Cut Pro, you''ll appreciate the power of the AMD Radeon HD 6770M, which lets you see more frames per second and experience better responsiveness. And the automatic graphics switching feature determines which graphics processor an application needs and switches instantly between the processors.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe. And it also now supports inertial scrolling, an intuitive way to scroll through large photo libraries, lengthy documents and long web sites.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 17-inch MacBook Pro" height="73" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-17-closed-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 17-inch MacBook Pro" height="50" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-17-ports-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> </div> <a name="techspecs"> <h4>Key Specifications</h4> <ul> <li><strong>17-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display</strong> with edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass (1920 x 1200-pixel resolution). </li> <li><strong>2.4 GHz Intel Core i7 quad-core processor</strong> ("Sandy Bridge") with 6 MB shared L3 cache for excellent multitasking. </li> <li><strong>Dual graphics processors with automatic switching</strong> between AMD Radeon HD 6770M (with 1 GB of GDDR5 video memory) for demanding applications and integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 (with 384 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory) for power savings. </li> <li><strong>750 GB Serial ATA hard drive</strong> (5400 RPM) </li> <li><strong>4 GB installed RAM</strong> (1333 MHz DDR3; supports up to 8 GB) </li> <li><strong>8x slot-loading SuperDrive</strong> with double-layer DVD support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW) </li> <li><strong>Built-in FaceTime HD camera</strong> for video chatting </li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi wireless networking</strong> (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible) </li> <li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet wired networking</strong> (10/100/1000) </li> <li><strong>Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</strong> for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones </li> <li><strong>Three USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 800 port</strong> </li> <li><strong>ExpressCard/34 slot</strong> </li> <li><strong>Thunderbolt port</strong> with native Mini DisplayPort output plus support for DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI, and HDMI (requires adapters, sold separately) </li> <li><strong>Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control</strong> with support for inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities </li> <li><strong>Full-size backlit keyboard</strong> </li> <li><strong>Stereo speakers with subwoofers</strong> </li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15.47 x 10.51 x 0.98 inches (WxDxH) </li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.6 pounds </li> <li><strong>Up to 7 hours of battery life</strong> </li> <li><strong>Meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements</strong> </li> <li><strong>Rated EPEAT Gold</strong> </li> </ul> <h5>What''s in the Box</h5> <p>17-inch MacBook Pro, display cleaning cloth, 85W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, power cord, printed and electronic documentation</p> <h5>Limited Warranty And Service</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty, which can be extended to 3 years with the AppleCare Protection Plan.</p> <h4>Installed Software</h4> <p>At the heart of every MacBook Pro--and every Mac--is OS X Lion, an operating system that''s both easy to use and incredibly powerful.

With the MacBook Pro all of those parts with just one part--the breakthrough unibody enclosure. Every MacBook Pro starts its life as a single block of aluminum, which is precisely machined into the basic unibody design. Another pass and the unibody takes shape. Another, and the integrated keyboard emerges. When you pick up a new MacBook Pro, you immediately notice the entire enclosure is thinner and lighter. And it feels strong and durable--perfect for life inside (and outside) your briefcase or backpack.</p> <p> <table align="center" cellpadding="10" width="700"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="173" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/macbookpro-unibody_trio.jpg" width="700" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <p> <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="500"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="340" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-macbook-pro_13-keyboard-500.jpg" width="500" /></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="248" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/macbookpro-17-battery-450.jpg" width="450" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>Off-the-shelf lithium-ion cells come in fixed, cylindrical shapes.

Use two fingers to scroll up and down a page. Pinch to zoom in and out. Rotate an image with your fingertips. Swipe with three fingers to flip through your photo libraries. Swipe with four fingers to show your desktop, view all open windows, or switch applications. The entire trackpad surface is also a button, allowing you to both track and click virtually anywhere on the trackpad. And you can easily enable multiple virtual buttons in software, such as right-clicking.</p> <p>The keyboard has also been improved, with the rigid aluminum keyboard webbing cut precisely to hold the keys, which are curved to perfectly fit fingers. And it''s illuminated, so when you''re in low-light settings, such as airplanes or conference rooms, you can always see what you''re typing.</p> <p>The 13-inch display is made of edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass for a smooth, seamless surface and features LED backlighting for brilliant instant-on performance that uses up to 30 percent less energy than its predecessor. The ultra-thin displays provide crisp images and vivid colors which are ideal for viewing photos and movies</p> <p><strong>Long-Lasting Battery</strong><br /> The 13-inch MacBook Pro now includes a newly engineered lithium-polymer battery that that lasts up to 7 hours on a single charge thanks to advanced chemistry, intelligent monitoring of the system and battery, and Adaptive Charging technology. The battery is built right into the computer, eliminating the space-consuming mechanisms and housings that standard removable batteries require. This non-removable battery also provides a longer battery lifespan of up to 1000 recharges--meaning fewer depleted batteries and less waste, which is better for the environment.</p> <p>Giving it a lifespan of up to 1000 recharges required breakthroughs in battery technology. Apple electro-chemists developed advanced chemistry that maintains the battery''s charging capabilities longer than ever. And while most notebooks wear down their batteries by charging them at a constant rate, the 13-inch MacBook Pro takes a different approach. Using an Apple-developed technology called Adaptive Charging, a microchip on the battery constantly communicates with the computer to determine the optimal way to charge its cells, adjusting the current up and down depending on a variety of conditions. Combined, these advancements offer a dramatic improvement in battery lifespan: more than three times the lifespan of typical notebook batteries--up to five years.</p> <p><strong>Intel Core 2 Duo Processor</strong><br /> Experience improved energy efficiency, expanded wireless connectivity, and amazing battery life with the 2.26 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which has a super-fast 1066 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and an large 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)</p> <p>The hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--conserves even more energy, giving you more time away from the wall outlet. With 3 MB of shared L2 cache, data and instructions can be kept close to the two processor cores, greatly increasing performance and allowing the entire system to work more efficiently. And, because the processor cores share the L2 cache, either can use the entire amount if the other happens to be idle.</p> <p> <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="450"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="252" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-macbook-pro_13-angle-450.jpg" width="450" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <strong>Video Processing & Output</strong><br /> The MacBook Pro delivers both powerful graphics performance and long battery life via the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics processor, which provides an outstanding everyday graphics experience with up to a 5x performance boost.

The Mini DisplayPort is ultra-compact at just 10 percent the size of a full DVI connector, and is compatible with Apple''s 24-inch Cinema Display. Adapters are also available for using VGA, DVI/HDMI and Dual-Link DVI displays</p> <p><strong>Hard Drive and Memory</strong><br /> The 160 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (5400 RPM) quickens the pace with a higher speed transfer of data--akin to USB 2.0.

Either way, Genius explores your library and finds songs that go great together. <p><b>Genius Playlists</b><br> Say you have one song you really love and want to hear other tracks that go great with it. A few clicks on iPod nano, and Genius uses that song to find other songs in your library and makes a Genius playlist for you. You can listen to the playlist right away, save it for later, or even refresh and give it another go. Count on Genius to create combinations you wouldn''t have thought of yourself. <p><b>Genius Mixes</b><br> Now there''s another great way to get a customized set of songs on iPod nano--have Genius do all the work. Introducing Genius Mixes. All you do is sync your iPod nano to iTunes, and Genius automatically searches your library and finds songs that sound great together to create up to 12 Genius Mixes. These mixes are like channels programmed entirely with your music. It''s a great way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in forever, and some you even forgot you had. <p><b>Go with the Cover Flow</b><br> View your album art in Cover Flow for a faster way to find the song you want to hear. Or just press and hold the center button to flip the album cover art over so you can see the songs. When you find the right song, press the center button to add it to your on-the-go playlist. <p><b>Shake to Shuffle Your Music</b><br> Hear songs in a totally random way. Just turn on Shake to Shuffle, then give iPod nano a shake and it shuffles to a different song in your music library. You never know what iPod nano will spin for you next. <h3>Don''t Just Listen to the Radio, Pause it and Tag it, Too</h3> The new FM tuner lets you see the names of songs and artists. And two amazing features--iTunes Tagging and Live Pause--make listening to the radio nothing like listening to the radio. <p><b>FM Radio--it Gives You Yet Another Way to Rock</b><br> There''s always something great on the FM dial. And now the FM tuner lets you hear your favorite morning shows on your commute and discover new music while you work out. It even shows you what and who you''re listening to.1 <p><b>With Live Pause, You''ll Never Miss a Beat</b><br> Say you need to take a quick break from listening to your favorite radio station. iPod nano lets you pause it with a click. Another click and you''re listening to your station again. You can even rewind as far back as 15 minutes, then fast-forward to catch up to the live broadcast. <p><b>iTunes Tagging--the New-Fashioned Way to Discover Music</b><br> It''s quite a dilemma: You''re listening to the radio and you hear a song you like, but when you go to iTunes, you can''t remember the name or even who sings it. Enter iTunes Tagging. Now, you can use the Click Wheel on iPod nano to tag the song. iTunes creates a list of all your tagged songs so you can easily preview or purchase them when you sync iPod nano to iTunes. <h3>VoiceOver--the Talk of the Music World</h3> VoiceOver tells you the title and artist of the songs you listen to. And does it so seamlessly, you''ll be surprised at how brilliant it is. <p><b>Let''s Talk VoiceOver</b><br> What if you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist?

A lot of thought went into creating an iPod nano that not only talks, but says the right things. It all begins with iTunes and its seamless integration with iPod nano. First, iTunes reads your song information, then uses the VoiceOver Kit to generate the announcements for the songs, artists, and playlists. Just sync your iPod nano to your computer and it really speaks to you. <p><b>It Speaks Multiple Languages</b><br> Your music library has songs from all over the world--a love song from France, a bolero from Spain, a pop tune from Japan. Luckily, VoiceOver speaks fluent song. <p>iTunes selects the language and best voice for your song titles and artist names. It looks at song data, like the title, artist, and album information, then applies intelligent algorithms to choose the right language. For example, iTunes recognizes the song "Ya Viene el Sol� by Ozomatli as a Spanish song, so your iPod nano will automatically speak that song title and artist in Spanish. If you prefer to hear that information spoken in another language, you can change the designated VoiceOver language for that song in iTunes. <h3>Hit the Ground Running--Or Walking</h3> With the Nike + iPod Sport Kit (sold separately) and a built-in pedometer to help keep you motivated and track your fitness progress, iPod nano makes working out less routine. <p><b>Step it up with the New Pedometer</b><br> You take your iPod nano with you everywhere. Why not use it to stay fit? iPod nano now doubles as a Pedometer. It uses the built-in accelerometer to keep track of your steps and help you meet your fitness goals. You can create a daily step goal or set it to Always On so it counts all the steps you take, all the time. Which makes iPod nano the ideal exercise partner. <p><b>Rock and Run</b><br> Your shoes and your iPod nano team up to maximize your run. See the minutes tick by. Watch the miles unfold. Hear real-time voice feedback. All to your favorite music, including your chosen Power Song--that one song that always gets you through the home stretch. <p><b>Rock the Gym</b><br> Take Nike + iPod to the gym and minute by minute, mile by mile, you''re motivated by more than music. Connect your iPod nano to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio machine. Record your pace, time, and distance as you work out. With iPod nano, every trip to the gym becomes a new challenge. <p><b>Sync</b><br> When you''re finished, connect your iPod nano to your Mac or PC. iTunes automatically sends your workout data to nikeplus.com. Every workout and every run is there, ready for you to review. Get pumped for your next run with recommended challenges, custom training programs, and maps of new routes to try. Or share motivation with runners across the world. <p><h3>Note to Self: Voice Memos Are Here</h3> The built-in mic lets you capture a thought, a reminder, a class lecture, or any audio recording you want with Voice Memos. <p><h3>iTunes: Your Greatest Hits</h3> It''s even easier to organize, browse, grow, and share your digital music and video collection with the new iTunes. And now you can save items with a wish list and enjoy iTunes extras--bonus features on select albums and movies--like lyrics, photos, interviews, and behind-the-scenes media. <p><h3>What''s in the Box</h3> Apple iPod nano 8 GB Black (5th Generation), Earphones, USB 2.0 cable, Dock adapter, Quick Start guide',2,NULL,N'v-b002l6hdpg',N'20120319 22:00:53.113',N'20120319 22:00:53.113',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

It features the latest Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O, a backlit keyboard, and OS X Lion, the next major release of the world''s most advanced desktop operating system. MacBook Air also comes standard with flash storage, so it boots up in seconds, launches apps quickly, and wakes from sleep in an instant. And a long-lasting battery powers MacBook Air for up to 5 hours and offers up to 30 days of standby time. All in a durable unibody design that''s thin, light, and ready for anything.</p>  <div class="rightImage" style="width:400px"> <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q3-macair11-main-sm.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Apple MacBook Air 11.6" /><div class="imageCaption">The MacBook Air with 11.6-inch screen--light, thin, and strong enough to take with you wherever you go (view larger).</div> </div>  <p>This version of the MacBook Air (model MC968LL/A) sports a 11.6-inch high-resolution display, 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor, 64 GB of flash memory storage, 2 GB of RAM, and an Intel HD Graphics 3000 integrated graphics processor (see full specifications below).

With over 250 features including Multi-Touch gestures, Mission Control, full-screen apps, and Launchpad, OS X Lion takes the Mac further than ever.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:200px"> <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q3-feat-lion-sm.jpg" width="150" height="153" alt="OS X Lion" /> </div>  <h5>Key OS X Lion Features</h5> <ul> <li>Mission Control provides a bird''s-eye view of everything running on your Mac. <li>Launchpad puts all your apps front and center for easy access. <li>View apps full screen and switch between them with a swipe. <li>Interact with your Mac using intuitive new Multi-Touch gestures. </ul>  <h4>Key Features</h4>  <h5>Flash Memory Storage</h5> <p>By replacing the standard spinning hard drive typically found in laptops (as well as desktop PCs) with flash memory, the MacBook Air delivers an almost instantaneous boot-up when you open the display, as well as faster application launches and snappier overall performance. Additionally, Apple has shed the enclosure that typically surrounds flash memory (usually about the same size as a standard hard drive), thus giving it a smaller footprint and helping to decrease the size of the MacBook Air.</p>  <div class="leftImage" style="width:400px"> <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q3-macair11-sideopen-sm.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Apple MacBook Air 11.6" /><div class="imageCaption">The ultimate do-everything, take-everywhere notebook<br>(view larger).</div> </div>  <h5>Revolutionary Thunderbolt Technology</h5> <p>Developed by Intel with collaboration from Apple, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O (input/output) technology delivers an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions.

Thunderbolt also supports DisplayPort for high resolution displays and works with existing adapters for HDMI, DVI, and VGA displays.</p>  <h5>Glass Multi-Touch Trackpad and Backlit Keyboard</h5> <p>With the smooth, glass Multi-Touch trackpad, the MacBook Air makes it easy to navigate OS X Lion and your software applications. You can pinch, swipe or rotate images on the display screen with the brush of two fingers, or add more digits for a four-fingered vertical swipe to open Expose and quickly glance at all of your open windows.</p>  <div class="rightImage" style="width:400px"> <img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q3-macair11-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Apple MacBook Air 11.6" /><div class="imageCaption">Spacious, full-sized keyboard with backlighting (view larger).</div> </div>  <p>In spite of its compact size, the MacBook Air has a full-size keyboard for comfortable, natural typing, and it''s backlit so you can keep typing in even the dimmest light.</p>  <h5>Integrated FaceTime Webcam</h5> <p>You''ll be able to easily connect with friends, family, and business colleagues using the MacBook Air''s FaceTime camera, which is integrated into the thin bezel above the display.

Once there, it acts just like any other photo. You can set it as your wallpaper, share it on the web, or pass it on.</p> <p><strong>Sync Photos</strong><br /> iPod touch uses iTunes to sync photos you have in iPhoto on a Mac or Adobe Photoshop Elements and Adobe Photoshop Album on a PC. Just choose which photos or albums to sync to your iPod touch, then you can look at them--and share them--anywhere you go. <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Calendar</strong></span><br />With iPod touch, it''s easy to make plans and stay on schedule. <p><strong>Add Events</strong><br /> Keep your schedule at your fingertips with iPod touch.

List view shows you all your appointments in the coming days as a comprehensive list, which you can scroll up and down. Day view displays one day''s worth of appointments visually. And Month view offers an at-a-glance look at an entire month. <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Contacts</strong></span><br />Put names, email addresses, phone numbers, and more at your fingertips. <p><strong>Make Contact</strong><br /> Build your contacts list on your Mac with Address Book or on your PC with Microsoft Outlook, then sync everything to your iPod touch using iTunes. You also can add contact information directly to your iPod touch from maps, web pages, and email. Next time you sync, your computer is updated, too.</p> <p><strong>Search Contacts</strong><br /> If you have a lot of contacts, a quick search shows you a list of matching names. Or you can scroll up and down your entire list to find the right contact. Want to send them an email? Just tap an email address and the Mail application opens automatically.</p> <p><strong>Organized by Groups</strong><br /> If you keep your contacts organized into groups--such as co-workers, friends, family, and so on--iPod touch will, too. And iPod touch can hold more than just names, email addresses, and phone numbers. You also can track birthdays, websites, nicknames, and notes. <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Stocks, Weather, and Notes</strong></span><br />Stay on top of it all. <p><strong>Check Stocks</strong><br /> Stocks on iPod touch shows you performance information for any stock you choose. When you want more details about a stock''s performance, tap the Y! for instant access to Yahoo! Finance.</p> <p><strong>Get Weather</strong><br /> Check worldwide weather at home or away.

Just slip the Nike + iPod Sensor (available separately) into your Nike+ shoe and start your run. The sensor communicates wirelessly with your iPod touch, tracking your time, distance, and calories burned. It even gives you voice feedback on your progress.</p> <p><strong>Tune Your Cardio Workout</strong><br /> This feature also works with new cardio equipment available in many fitness centers. Just look for treadmills, ellipticals, stair steppers, and stationary bikes that are Nike + iPod compatible.</p> <p><strong>Sync with Nikeplus.com</strong><br /> When you get back to your computer, sync your iPod touch via iTunes and transfer your exercise data to nikeplus.com, where you can track your workouts, set goals, and challenge friends. <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Multi-Touch</strong></span><br />iPod touch features the same revolutionary interface as iPhone. <p><strong>Glide, Flick, Pinch</strong><br /> Built to take full advantage of the large 3.5-inch display, the Multi-Touch touchscreen interface lets you control everything using only your fingers. So you can glide through albums with Cover Flow, flick through photos and enlarge them with a pinch, zoom in and out on a section of a web page, and control game elements precisely.</p> <p><strong>How it Works</strong><br /> The Multi-Touch display layers a protective shield over a capacitive panel that senses your touch using electrical fields. It then transmits that information to the LCD screen below it. iPod touch software enables the flick, tap, and pinch.</p> <p><strong>Type with the Touchscreen Keyboard</strong><br /> iPod touch features an intelligent touchscreen keyboard perfect for browsing the web in Safari, getting directions on a map, searching for videos on YouTube, finding music on the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store, or adding new contacts. It analyzes keystrokes to suggest words as you type and correct spelling errors automatically. And because it''s software based, it changes its keys to support typing in multiple languages. <table align="left" cellpadding="20" width="300"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/B001FA1NZK-15.jpg" /> <p><small><strong><em>iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks.</em></strong></small></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Accelerometer</strong></span><br />iPod touch responds to motion using a built-in accelerometer. <p><strong>Responds to Movement</strong><br /> iPod touch detects when you rotate it from portrait to landscape, then automatically changes the contents of the display. So you immediately see the entire width of a web page, view a photo in its proper aspect ratio, or control a game using only your movements.</p> <p><strong>How it Works</strong><br /> The accelerometer inside iPod touch uses three elements: a silicon mass, a set of silicon springs, and an electrical current. The silicon springs measure the position of the silicon mass using the electrical current. Rotating iPod touch causes a fluctuation in the electrical current passing through the silicon springs. The accelerometer registers these fluctuations and tells iPod touch to adjust the display accordingly.</p> <p><strong>Perfect for Gaming</strong><br /> Accelerometer technology really shines when you play games because it immerses you in the action. It''s perfect for racing games--where your entire iPod touch acts as a steering wheel--and for tap-and-tilt games like Super Monkey Ball, in which your character responds to your every movement. <br /><br /></p> <span class="h3color"><strong>Wireless</strong></span><br />Connect iPod touch to the Internet anywhere there''s a wireless network. <p><strong>Connect Automatically</strong><br /> iPod touch locates nearby wireless hotspots, including protected networks. If you''ve never used a particular network, it asks you to enter a password the first time, and it remembers the password from then on. So the next time you''re within range, it connects automatically.</p> <p><strong>Surf''s Up</strong><br /> Now you can send email from a coffee shop. Surf the web at the airport. Shop for games from your couch. Browse, buy, and download music from the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store at select Starbucks locations or other wireless hotspots in your area. <br /><br /></p> <p><span class="h3color"><strong>Read Kindle Books on the iPod touch</strong></span> <table align="left" cellpadding="20" width="300"> <tbody> <tr> <td align="center"><img border="0" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/kindle/lassen/touch-side-by-side._V250440637_.jpg" /> <p><small><strong><em>Read Kindle books on your iPod touch. </em></strong></small></p> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <ul> <li>No Kindle required. </li> <li>Get the best reading experience available on your iPhone or iPod touch. </li> <li>Access your Kindle books even if you don''t have your Kindle with you. </li> <li>Automatically synchronizes your last page read between devices with Amazon Whispersync. </li> <li>Adjust the text size, add bookmarks, and view the annotations you created on your Kindle. </li> <li>Don''t have a Kindle?

Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i7" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i7-sandy-120.jpg" width="120" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Dual-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i7 dual-core processor (dubbed "Sandy Bridge"), which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i7 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The "Sandy Bridge" Core i7 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 4 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe. And it also now supports inertial scrolling, an intuitive way to scroll through large photo libraries, lengthy documents and long web sites.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="77" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-closed-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="47" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-ports-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> </div> <a name="techspecs"> <h4></h4> <h4></h4> <h4>Key Specifications</h4> <ul> <li><strong>13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display</strong> with edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass (1280 x 800-pixel resolution). </li> <li><strong>2.7 GHz Intel Core i7 dual-core processor</strong> ("Sandy Bridge") with 4 MB shared L3 cache for excellent multitasking. </li> <li><strong>Intel HD Graphics 3000</strong> with 384 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory. </li> <li><strong>500 GB Serial ATA hard drive</strong> (5400 RPM) </li> <li><strong>4 GB installed RAM</strong> (1333 MHz DDR3; supports up to 8 GB) </li> <li><strong>8x slot-loading SuperDrive</strong> with double-layer DVD support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW) </li> <li><strong>Built-in FaceTime HD camera</strong> for video chatting </li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi wireless networking</strong> (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible) </li> <li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet wired networking</strong> (10/100/1000) </li> <li><strong>Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</strong> for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones </li> <li><strong>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 800 port</strong> </li> <li><strong>SDXC card slot</strong> </li> <li><strong>Thunderbolt port</strong> with native Mini DisplayPort output plus support for DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI, and HDMI (requires adapters, sold separately) </li> <li><strong>Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control</strong> with support for inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities </li> <li><strong>Full-size backlit keyboard</strong> </li> <li><strong>Stereo speakers with subwoofers</strong> </li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12.78 x 8.94 x 0.95 inches (WxDxH) </li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.5 pounds </li> <li><strong>Up to 7 hours of battery life</strong> </li> <li><strong>Meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements</strong> </li> <li><strong>Rated EPEAT Gold</strong> </li> </ul> <h5>What''s in the Box</h5> <p>13.3-inch MacBook Pro, display cleaning cloth, 60W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, power cord, software DVDs, printed and electronic documentation</p> <h5>Limited Warranty And Service</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty, which can be extended to 3 years with the AppleCare Protection Plan.</p> <h4>Installed software</h4> <p>Mac OS X Lion is an even more powerful and refined version of the world''s most advanced operating system.

It includes a 15.4-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology. And it comes standard with automatic graphics switching that provides performance when you need it and energy efficiency when you don''t. You''ll also get up to 7 hours of battery life while on the go.</p> <p>This version of the 15.4-inch MacBook Pro (model MD318LL/A) features a second-generation 2.2 GHz Core i7 quad-core processor, 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include ultra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an SDXC card slot, two USB 2.0 ports, and a FireWire 800 port (see full specifications below).</p> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="215" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-11q4-mbp-15-frontface-lion-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">FaceTime HD camera built into the bezel for crisp, widescreen video chats (see larger image).</div> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 15.4-inch MacBook Pro" height="205" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-15-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings (see larger image).</div> </div> <h4>OS X Lion</h4> <p>Every Mac comes with OS X Lion, the latest release of the world''s most advanced desktop operating system.

Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i7" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i7-sandy-120.jpg" width="120" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Quad-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i7 quad-core processor, which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i7 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The Core i7 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 6 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 100px;"><img alt="AMD Radeon Graphics" height="90" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/amdbadge-2011-radeongraphics-sm.jpg" width="73" /></div> <h5>Automatic Graphics Switching</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro offers excellent graphics flexibility with two video processors--the discrete AMD Radeon HD 6750M processor (with 512 MB of GDDR5 video memory) for heavier workloads and an integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 processor for better battery life on the go. When gaming or using processor-intensive applications like Aperture or Final Cut Pro, you''ll appreciate the power of the AMD Radeon HD 6750M, which lets you see more frames per second and experience better responsiveness. And the automatic graphics switching feature determines which graphics processor an application needs and switches instantly between the processors.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe.

These displays have more processing power than standard 2D models for displaying 3D images in rapid succession.</td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center" valign="middle"><img border="0" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page2/3dcl-2.jpg" /></td> <td valign="middle"><span class="h3color"><strong>A Source</strong></span><br />Your display may be ready for 3D playback, but you''ll still need a device to read 3D content.

This latest iteration of the affordable "white" MacBook line (model MC240LL/A) gets a boost in processing power thanks to the 2.13 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor as well as storage space with a 160 GB hard drive--plenty of room for music, photos, videos, and more. <p>This go-anywhere notebook also features a 13.3-inch glossy widescreen display, excellent video processing power from the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics chip, 2 GB of installed RAM (with a 4 GB maximum capacity), and an integrated 802.11n Wi-Fi LAN that provides compatibility with older 802.11b/g routers as well as the faster throughput of Apple''s Airport Extreme. It also includes an 8x combo Superdrive for burning dual-layer DVDs as well as CDs.</p> <p> <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="450"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="301" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/macbook-white-hero-450.jpg" width="384" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>Measuring 1.08 inches thin and weighing only 5.0 pounds, the MacBook cuts a slim profile on any desk (or in any backpack or briefcase). See a larger version of this image</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> Measuring a mere 1.08 inches thin and weighing in at only 5.0 pounds, the MacBook cuts a slim profile on any desk (or in any backpack or briefcase). A durable polycarbonate shell in white keeps it ready for the rough and tumble of everyday life. It also offers a unique keyboard design that sits flush against the bed for a sleeker, lower profile--which means you experience a firm, responsive touch when typing. Other standard Apple "extras" includes a built-in iSight video camera and Apple''s magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter, which safely disconnects when under strain.</p> <p>It comes pre-loaded with Apple''s Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard operating system--an operating system custom-designed for the advanced technology inside--and it also comes with the iLife ''09 suite of applications, including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes. </p> <p>Other hardware features include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet for high-speed networking, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), two USB ports, a FireWire 400 port, and Mini-DVI video output.</p> <p><strong>Apple Innovations</strong><br /> One of Apple''s most celebrated innovations is the MagSafe power adapter connector with offers a magnetic connection instead of a physical one. So, if you happen to trip over a power cord, you won''t send MacBook flying off a table or desk--the cord simply disconnects, without damage to either the cord or the system. As an added nicety, this means less wear on the connectors.</p> <p>Cleverly integrated above your MacBook display is an iSight camera, providing easy video chat capability when using iChat. You can also snap photos in Photo Booth to send via email, as well as record videos and then edit them in iMovie before uploading them to web sites.</p> <p> <table align="right" cellpadding="5" width="200"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/apple-macbook-new-plug-6-19-07._V17508185_.gif" /><br /><small><br /><strong><em> The magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter breaks cleanly away, without damage to either the cord or the MacBook, if you trip over the cord. </em></strong></small></td> </tr> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="153" src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/twofingerscrolling.jpg" width="200" /><br /><small><br /><strong><em>With two-finger scrolling, the trackpad becomes a fast track to wherever you want to go.</em></strong></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The trackpad can tell if you''ve got one finger on the pedal, or two. With two, you can easily scroll around your documents or open contextual menus. When you need right-click functionality, simply open "Keyboard and Mouse" in System Preferences and enable the secondary click preference. Opening and closing your MacBook is also a pleasure, thanks to a magnetic latch that catches without a catch. And because it''s a magnet, there are no moving parts to snag, jam, or break.</p> <p><strong>Intel Core 2 Duo Processor</strong><br /> Experience improved energy efficiency, expanded wireless connectivity, and amazing battery life with the workhorse Intel Core 2 Duo processor, which has a 2.13 GHz processor speed, ultra-fast 1066 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and a large 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)</p> <p> <table align="left" cellpadding="10" width="350"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="547" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/macbook-white-leftside.jpg" width="350" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> The hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--conserves even more energy, giving you more time away from the wall outlet. With a substantial 3 MB of shared L2 cache, data and instructions can be kept close to the two processor cores, greatly increasing performance and allowing the entire system to work more efficiently. And, because the processor cores share the L2 cache, either can use the entire amount if the other happens to be idle.</p> <p><strong>Hard Drive and Memory</strong><br /> The 160 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (5400 RPM) quickens the pace with a higher speed transfer of data--akin to FireWire and USB 2.0. The 2 GB of DDR2 RAM (two SO-DIMMs of 512 MB) have an 800 MHz speed, and the RAM capacity can be increased to 4 GB.</p> <p><strong>Wireless Connectivity</strong><br /> The built-in 802.11n wireless networking provides up to five times the performance and twice the range of 802.11g, but it''s also backward-compatible with 802.11a/b/g routers, enabling you to communicate with the a wide variety of Wi-Fi resources. It works seamlessly with the new AirPort Extreme with 802.11n. Use the built-in Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to your PDA or cell phone, synchronize addresses, or download pictures from your cell phone. You can also use a wireless headset for iChat audio chats and VoIP calls as well as quickly share files with a colleague.</p> <p><strong>Display and Graphics</strong><br /> Whether you''re working on a Keynote presentation or watching a movie before you catch a flight, every document, video, and photo on your MacBook will look sharp on the glossy 13.3-inch widescreen display. With pixel-perfect 1280-by-800 resolution, it''s great for viewing and working with media. Video is powered by the integrated NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor, which shares 256 MB of DDR2 SDRAM with main memory. Graphics-intensive features in iPhoto and iMovie are smoother and 3D game play--from Spore to Call of Duty--is faster and more responsive. You''ll get extended desktop and video mirroring, with simultaneous support of full native resolution on the built-in display and up to 1920 by 1200 pixels on an external display--both at millions of colors</p> <p><strong>Video Conferencing with Built-in iSight</strong><br /> Artfully placed in the display bezel is an iSight camera, which enables easy video conferencing as well as allows you to snap pictures of yourself and create video podcasts. Using the iChat AV application, video conferencing is integrated into your iChat buddy list, so initiating a video conference is a breeze. iChat also lets you hold audio chats with up to 10 people and provides high-quality audio compression and full-duplex sound so conversation can flow naturally. For video podcasting, you can record a short clip using the iSight camera, then use iWeb to create a video blog entry or post your GarageBand-recorded podcast.</p> <p><strong>Other Features</strong><br /> <table align="right" cellpadding="10" width="500"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img align="top" border="0" height="121" src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/macbook-white-rightside-ports.jpg" width="500" /><br /><br /><small><em><strong>Connect to your network, a desktop monitor and all your peripherals with two USB 2.0, one FireWire, one Mini-DVI video output, and one Gigabit Ethernet.</strong></em></small></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </p> <ul> <li>Slot-loading SuperDrive with double-layer support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW): Writes DVD+R DL and DVD-R DL discs at up to 4x speed, writes DVD-R and DVD+R discs at up to 8x speed, writes DVD±RW discs at up to 4x speed; writes CD-R and CD-RW discs at up to 24x speed; reads DVDs at up to 8x speed; reads CDs at up to 24x speed </li> <li>Mini-DVI port for video output (VGA adapter and mini-DVI to DVI adapter sold separately) </li> <li>Built-in stereo speakers and omnidirectional microphone </li> <li>Combined optical digital audio input/audio line in </li> <li>Combined optical digital audio output/headphone out </li> <li>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 400 port </li> <li>Built-in full-size keyboard with 78 (U.S.) or 79 (ISO) keys, including 12 function keys, 4 arrow keys (inverted "T" arrangement), and embedded numeric keypad </li> <li>Solid-state scrolling trackpad for precise cursor control; supports two-finger scrolling, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities </li> <li>Kensington cable lock slot </li> <li>Meets ENERGY STAR requirements </li> <li>Measures 12.78 x 8.92 x 1.08 inches (WxDxH) and weighs 5 pounds </li> </ul> <p> <p> <b>Pre-Loaded with Mac OS X Snow Leopard and iLife ''09</b><br> <table align=right width=350 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple-mac-feature-snowleopard.jpg" border=0 align=top width=350 height=322></td></tr> </table> Every Mac comes with Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the world''s most advanced operating system, and iLife, Apple''s innovative suite of applications for managing photos, making movies and creating and learning to play music.

Apple engineers removed the majority of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from circuit boards, internal cables, connectors, insulators, adhesives, and more in the MacBook.</p> <p>Because Apple makes both the hardware and the software for the MacBook, they''re designed to work together to produce a smarter product that uses less electricity. For instance, to reduce energy consumption, the MacBook hard drive spins down automatically when inactive. The MacBook also decides which processor--CPU or GPU--is best suited to efficiently perform a task. The processor even throttles down to save power between keystrokes as you type. Together, these adjustments make the MacBook much more energy efficient and result in fewer CO2 emissions.</p> <p>The MacBook meets the stringent low power requirements set by the EPA, giving it ENERGY STAR certification. MacBook also meets the latest efficiency requirements of ENERGY STAR Version 5.0 Specification for Computers before its July 2009 effective date.</p> <p>The MacBook has also earned the highest rating of EPEAT Gold. The Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool, or EPEAT, evaluates the environmental impact of a product based on how recyclable it is, how much energy it uses, and how it’s designed and manufactured.</p> <p><strong>What''s in the Box</strong><br /> MacBook (model MC240LL/A), 60W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, and power cord, lithium-polymer battery, install/restore DVDs, printed and electronic documentation</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b001p05njc',N'20120319 22:01:17.587',N'20120319 22:01:17.587',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

The state-of-the-art dual-core Intel i5 processor delivers up to 2x faster performance (over the previous generation of MacBook Pro). New Thunderbolt technology lets you connect high-performance peripherals and high-resolution displays to a single port, and transfer files at lightning speeds. And with the new built-in FaceTime HD camera, you can make astonishingly crisp HD video calls.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="190" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-angle_fcp-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The 13.3-inch unibody MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt technology (see larger image).</div> </div> <p>With the revolutionary Thunderbolt technology, you''ll be able to achieve bi-directional channels with transfer speeds to peripherals like external hard drives and servers up to an amazing 10 Gbps--while also connecting to a DisplayPort-compatible high-resolution display.</p> <p>As with previous models, the MacBook Pro features a precision unibody enclosure crafted from a single block of aluminum, creating a thin and light mobile computing workhorse (less than 1 inch thin and just 4.5 pounds) that''s also highly durable. And it includes a 13.3-inch, LED-backlit glass display as well as a glass trackpad that doesn''t include a button (for larger tracking area) that features Apple''s Multi-Touch technology. You''ll also get up to 7 hours of battery life while on the go.</p> <p>This version of the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro (model MC700LL/A) features a 2.3 GHz Core i5 "Sandy Bridge" dual-core processor, 320 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of installed RAM. Other features include integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics, ultra-fast Wireless-N Wi-Fi networking, Bluetooth connectivity, an SDXC card slot, two USB 2.0 ports, and a FireWire 800 port (see full specifications below). It also comes with the Mac OS X Lion operating system as well as the iLife software suite, which includes the latest versions of iPhoto, iMovie, and GarageBand.</p> <table cellpadding="8"> <div class="leftImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="207" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-frontface_osx-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">FaceTime HD camera built into the bezel for crisp, widescreen video chats (see larger image).</div> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="209" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">The backlit keyboard--great for typing in low-light settings (see larger image).</div> </div> <h4>Key Features</h4> <h5>Revolutionary Thunderbolt Technology</h5> <p>Developed by Intel with collaboration from Apple, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O (input/output) technology delivers an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions. Built into the MacBook Pro, the Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You''ll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain multiple high-speed devices without using a hub.</p> <p>And because Thunderbolt is based on DisplayPort technology, you''ll be able to connect to a high-resolution display from the same port. Any Mini DisplayPort display plugs right into the Thunderbolt port, and you can also connect displays that use DisplayPort, DVI, HDMI, or VGA connections with an existing adapter. You''ll also be able to include your display into a daisy-chained set of peripherals.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 150px;"><img alt="Intel Core i5" height="83" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/intelbadge-2011-core_i5-sandy-110.jpg" width="110" /></div> <h5>Next-Generation Dual-Core Intel Processor</h5> <p>This MacBook Pro is powered by a second-generation Intel Core i5 dual-core processor (dubbed "Sandy Bridge"), which provides breakthrough digital media management, content creation, and 3D gaming capabilities. With updated Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0, the latest Core i5 increases speed automatically for whatever you''re doing, dynamically accelerating performance to match your workload.</p> <p>Intel''s Hyper-Threading Technology enables each core of your processor to work on two tasks at the same time, delivering the performance you need for smart multitasking. And you''ll enjoy a rich set of new features for a stunning and seamless visual experience with no additional hardware. The "Sandy Bridge" Core i5 processor also provides faster access to the installed RAM, with an integrated memory controller to connect fast 1333 MHz memory directly to the processor.</p> <p>With new microarchitecture, the graphics processor resides on the same chip as the central processor and has direct access to the 3 MB of shared L3 cache--helping your applications run at peak performance. And an integrated video encoder enables HD video calls with FaceTime, while an efficient decoder gives you long battery life when you''re watching DVDs or iTunes movies.</p> <h5>Buttonless Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With no button on the glass trackpad, there''s more room to track and click--left, right, center, and everywhere in between. Without a separate button, the trackpad gives your hands plenty of room to move on the large, silky glass surface. It also incorporates Multi-Touch gestures--including swipe, pinch, rotate, and four-finger swipe. And it also now supports inertial scrolling, an intuitive way to scroll through large photo libraries, lengthy documents and long web sites.</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width: 350px;"><img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="77" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-closed-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> <p> </p> <p> </p> <img alt="Apple 13.3-inch MacBook Pro" height="47" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-mbp2011-13-ports-sm.jpg" width="350" /> <div class="imageCaption">See larger image.</div> </div> <a name="techspecs"> <h4>Key Specifications</h4> <ul> <li><strong>13.3-inch LED-backlit glossy widescreen display</strong> with edge-to-edge, uninterrupted glass (1280 x 800-pixel resolution). </li> <li><strong>2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 dual-core processor</strong> ("Sandy Bridge") with 3 MB shared L3 cache for excellent multitasking. </li> <li><strong>Intel HD Graphics 3000</strong> with 384 MB of DDR3 SDRAM shared with main memory. </li> <li><strong>320 GB Serial ATA hard drive</strong> (5400 RPM) </li> <li><strong>4 GB installed RAM</strong> (1333 MHz DDR3; supports up to 8 GB) </li> <li><strong>8x slot-loading SuperDrive</strong> with double-layer DVD support (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW) </li> <li><strong>Built-in FaceTime HD camera</strong> for video chatting </li> <li><strong>Wi-Fi wireless networking</strong> (based on 802.11n specification; 802.11a/b/g compatible) </li> <li><strong>Gigabit Ethernet wired networking</strong> (10/100/1000) </li> <li><strong>Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</strong> for connecting with peripherals such as keyboards, mice and cell phones </li> <li><strong>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 800 port</strong> </li> <li><strong>SDXC card slot</strong> </li> <li><strong>Thunderbolt port</strong> with native Mini DisplayPort output plus support for DVI, VGA, dual-link DVI, and HDMI (requires adapters, sold separately) </li> <li><strong>Multi-Touch trackpad for precise cursor control</strong> with support for inertial scrolling, pinch, rotate, swipe, three-finger swipe, four-finger swipe, tap, double-tap, and drag capabilities </li> <li><strong>Full-size backlit keyboard</strong> </li> <li><strong>Stereo speakers with subwoofers</strong> </li> <li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12.78 x 8.94 x 0.95 inches (WxDxH) </li> <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 4.5 pounds </li> <li><strong>Up to 7 hours of battery life</strong> </li> <li><strong>Meets Energy Star 5.0 requirements</strong> </li> <li><strong>Rated EPEAT Gold</strong> </li> </ul> <h5>What''s in the Box</h5> <p>13.3-inch MacBook Pro, display cleaning cloth, 60W MagSafe Power Adapter, AC wall plug, power cord, software DVDs, printed and electronic documentation</p> <h5>Limited Warranty And Service</h5> <p>The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty, which can be extended to 3 years with the AppleCare Protection Plan.</p> <h4>Installed software</h4> <p>Mac OS X Lion is an even more powerful and refined version of the world''s most advanced operating system.

As beautiful as it is wearable.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleek, polished aluminum. Five brilliant colors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Its main body is crafted from a single piece of aluminum and polished to a beautiful shine, so the new iPod shuffle feels solid, sleek, and durable. And the color palette makes it the perfect fashion accessory. Choose gleaming silver, blue, green, orange, or pink.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hundreds of songs to go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Never leave a favorite tune behind. Along with up to 15 hours of battery life, iPod shuffle gives you 2 GB of storage capacity, good for hundreds of songs. That''s plenty of room for the essential songs for your workout or commute. And for multiple playlists, Genius Mixes, podcasts, and audiobooks.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goes anywhere. And with anything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; iPod shuffle isn''t just portable. It''s wearable, too. Clip it to your shirt, jacket, workout gear, backpack, or purse strap, and it stays put--whether you''re running an errand or running around the track.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Controls. Right on the button.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control your music with just a click&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It''s back--the big, clickable control pad on the front of iPod shuffle. It''s 18 percent larger than on previous iPod shuffle models, so it''s even easier to see and use the music controls. Press the center button to play and pause. Press the outer buttons to skip forward or back and adjust volume. Click, click, click. It''s music to your fingers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play it your way&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Maybe you''re the spontaneous type. Or maybe you prefer a little order. Just flip the shuffle switch to suit your listening style. Flip it to the left, and you''ll hear your music in a refreshingly random way. Flip it to the middle, and your songs play in order. Or flip to the right to turn iPod shuffle off.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;VoiceOver. It tells you what you want to hear.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Give your songs a voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Say you''re listening to a song and want to know the title or the artist. Just press the new VoiceOver button on top of your iPod shuffle, and it tells you. You can even use VoiceOver to hear the names of playlists and switch between them. And if your battery needs charging, VoiceOver tells you that, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It speaks your language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A French love song. A Spanish bolero. An Italian cantata. Your music library has songs from all over the world. That''s why VoiceOver speaks 25 different languages. So it can tell you song titles and artists in their native tongues or any language you choose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Playlists. The perfect mix for every mood.&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sync to your heart''s content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; iTunes on your Mac or PC makes it easy to load up your iPod shuffle. Just choose the playlists, audiobooks, podcasts, and other audio files you want, then sync.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When one playlist isn''t enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You probably have multiple playlists in iTunes on your computer. One for your commute. One for the gym. One for just relaxing. Sync all those playlists to iPod shuffle, and you can play the perfect mix for whatever mood strikes you. VoiceOver tells you the name of each playlist, so it''s easy to switch between them and find the one you want without looking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genius comes to iPod shuffle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There''s another way to get a good mix of music on iPod shuffle: let Genius do the work. Activate Genius in iTunes on your computer, and it automatically finds songs that sound great together. Then it creates Genius Mixes, which you can easily sync to your iPod shuffle. It''s the perfect way to rediscover songs you haven''t listened to in, like, forever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What''s in the Box?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;2 GB iPod shuffle (green), Apple earphones, iPod shuffle USB cable (45 mm), quick start guide, and other important product information.&lt;/p&gt;',2,NULL,N'951752ca-6abc-4bad-96a7-7f1739c04da0',N'20130403 09:06:07.937',N'20130403 09:06:07.937',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

And it gets a serious speed bump from Intel''s latest 2.4 GHz 45-nanometer Penryn series Core 2 Duo processor, which also helps to reduce power requirements and save on battery life. This model (MB133LL/A ) also has a mercury-free, power-efficient LED-backlit display measuring 15.4 inches and a state-of-the art NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT video card with 256 MB of GDDR3 video RAM.<p> <table align=right width=400 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/macbookpro-15.jpg" border=0 align=top width="400" height="250"><br><br><small><i><b>The 15-inch MacBook Pro offers a mercury-free, power-efficient LED-backlit display with an antiglare finish that''s perfect for color-minded professionals.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> Meticulously designed and encased in sleek and sturdy aluminum, the MacBook Pro measures just 1 inch thin and weighs 5.4 pounds. Your hands have room to spread out on the full-size keyboard with crisp, responsive keys, and the MacBook Pro has a built-in ambient light sensor that adjusts the keyboard and display brightness so it’s easy to work in low-light settings. Other standard Apple "extras" includes a built-in iSight video camera and Apple''s magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter, which safely disconnects when under strain. <p> It''s pre-loaded with Apple''s Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system, which enables easy backup of your most important data via Time Machine, a redesigned desktop that helps eliminate clutter. It also comes with the iLife ''08 suite of applications--including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes--and the newest version of the fast-loading Safari web browser. Other hardware features include a 200 GB hard drive, 2 GB of installed RAM (which can be upgraded to 4 GB), an 8x combo Superdrive (for burning dual-layer DVDs as well as CDs), built-in Gigabit Ethernet for high-speed networking, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), FireWire 400 and 800 ports, DVI video output, and an ExpressCard/34 expansion card slot for expansion solutions such as 3G wireless networking. <p> <b>Apple Innovations</b><br> The MacBook Pro is the culmination of years of refining hardware and software design to an integrated art, and Apple''s Multi-Touch technology is just the latest innovation to be added to it. The advanced trackpad now allows you to flip through photos, enlarge text, and adjust an image using just your fingers. It also comes with a MagSafe power adapter connector, which offers a magnetic connection instead of a physical one. So, if you happen to trip over a power cord, you won''t send MacBook Pro flying off a table or desk--the cord simply disconnects, without damage to either the cord or the system. <p> <table align=left width=160 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/indexmagplug20061024._V12312312_.png" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter breaks cleanly away, without damage to either the cord or the MacBook Pro.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> The MacBook Pro has battery life that rivals most notebooks in its class. If you''d like to make that battery last even longer, Mac OS X has a few tricks up its sleeve. Go to System Preferences, click Energy Saver, and change battery optimization from Normal to Better Battery Life. Or tell MacBook Pro to reduce its screen brightness and give yourself a little more time untethered. <p> <b>Intel Core 2 Duo Processor</b><br> Experience improved energy efficiency, expanded wireless connectivity, and amazing battery life with the 45nm Penryn series Intel Core 2 Duo T8300 processor, which has a 2.40 GHz processor speed, super-fast 800 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and a large 3 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.) <p> The new hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors--conserves even more energy, giving you more time away from the wall outlet. With a substantial 3 MB of shared L2 cache, data and instructions can be kept close to the two processor cores, greatly increasing performance and allowing the entire system to work more efficiently. And, because the processor cores share the L2 cache, either can use the entire amount if the other happens to be idle. <p> <table align=right width=400 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/macbookpro-keyboard.jpg" border=0 align=top width="400" height="239"><br><br><small><i><b>Your hands have room to spread out on the full-size keyboard with crisp, responsive keys.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> <b>Hard Drive and Memory</b><br> The 200 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (5400 RPM) quickens the pace with a higher speed transfer of data--akin to FireWire and USB 2.0. The 2 GB of PC5300 DDR2 RAM (two SO-DIMMs of 1024 MB) have an industry-leading 667 MHz speed, and the RAM capacity can be increased to 4 GB. <p> <b>Wireless Connectivity</b><br> The built-in 802.11n wireless networking provides up to five times the performance and twice the range of 802.11g, but it''s also backward-compatible with 802.11a/b/g routers, enabling you to communicate with the a wide variety of Wi-Fi resources. It works seamlessly with the new AirPort Extreme with 802.11n. Use the built-in Bluetooth wireless technology to connect to your PDA or cell phone, synchronize addresses, or download pictures from your cell phone. You can also use a wireless headset for iChat audio chats and VoIP calls as well as quickly share files with a colleague. <p> <b>Display and Graphics</b><br> The 15.4-inch widescreen TFT display offers a native resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels and an antiglare widescreen display that''s perfect for color-minded professionals. The display is backlit by light emitting diodes (LEDs), which gives it a lighter weight and more power efficiency than the cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) which most notebooks employ. It''s also better for the environment, thanks to its new mercury-free display. <p> Video and graphics are powered by the NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT card, which is boosted by 256 MB of GDDR3 SDRAM. GDDR3 (Graphics Double Data Rate, version 3) is a graphics card-specific memory technology that''s better able to deliver fluid frame rates for even the most advanced games and applications. The GeForce 8600M GT brings a new level of realism to the MacBook Pro with its 16-lane PCI Express architecture, 16x full screen anti-aliasing, 128-bit High Dynamic Range rendering, and a texture fill rate of up to 8.2 billion per second. <p> <b>Video Conferencing with Built-in iSight</b><br> Artfully placed in the display bezel is an iSight camera, which enables easy video conferencing as well as allows you to snap pictures of yourself and create video podcasts. Using the iChat AV application, video conferencing is integrated into your iChat buddy list, so initiating a video conference is a breeze. iChat also lets you hold audio chats with up to 10 people and provides high-quality audio compression and full-duplex sound so conversation can flow naturally. For video podcasting, you can record a short clip using the iSight camera, then use iWeb to create a video blog entry or post your GarageBand-recorded podcast. <p> <table align=right width=400 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/macbookpro-connections-15.jpg" border=0 align=top width="400" height="139"><br><br><small><i><b>Connect to your network, a desktop monitor and all your peripherals with two USB 2.0, one FireWire 400, one FireWire 800, one DVI video output, and one Gigabit Ethernet.</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> <b>Other Features</b><br> <ul> <li>Two USB 2.0 ports, one FireWire 400, one FireWire 800, ExpressCard/34 slot <li>DVI output port; VGA output using included DVI to VGA adapter <li>8x slot-loading SuperDrive with the following write speeds: 8x DVD±R; 4x DVD±R DL (double layer); 4x DVD±RW; 24x CD-R; 10x CD-RW <li>Backlit keyboard with ambient light sensors for automatic adjustment of keyboard illumination and screen brightness <li>Internal omnidirectional microphone and built-in speakers <li>Combined optical digital output/headphone out (minijack) <li>Combined optical digital input/audio line in (minijack) <li>60-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery (with integrated charge indicator LEDs) providing up to 6 hours of battery life <li>Kensington cable lock slot <li>Measures 14.1 x 9.6 x 1 inches (WxDxH) and weighs 5.4 pounds (including battery) </ul> <p> <table align=left width=300 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://g-ec2.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/apple/macbookupgr-leopard-stacks.jpg" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>Preloaded with Leopard, you''ll enjoy enhanced productivity and a clutter-free desktop (thanks to the redesigned 3-D Dock with Stacks).</b></i></small></td></tr> </table> <b>Preloaded with Leopard and iLife ''08</b><br> The biggest Mac OS X upgrade ever, the Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard operating system features over 300 new features, including: <ul> <li>Time Machine, an effortless way to automatically back up everything on a Mac <li>A redesigned Finder that lets users quickly browse and share files between multiple Macs <li>Quick Look, a new way to instantly see files without opening an application <li>Spaces, an intuitive new feature used to create groups of applications and instantly switch between them <li>A brand new desktop with Stacks, a new way to easily access files from the Dock <li>Major enhancements to Mail and iChat </ul> Leopard''s new desktop includes the redesigned 3-D Dock with Stacks, a new way to organize files for quick and easy access with just one click.

Additionally, Apple has shed the enclosure that typically surrounds flash memory (usually about the same size as a standard hard drive), thus giving it a smaller footprint and helping to decrease the size of the MacBook Air.</p> <h5>Glass Multi-Touch Trackpad</h5> <p>With the addition of the smooth, glass Multi-Touch trackpad previously found on other MacBook models, the MacBook Air makes it even easier to navigate Mac OS X and your software applications. You can pinch, swipe or rotate images on the display screen with the brush of two fingers, or add more digits for a four-fingered vertical swipe to open Expose and quickly glance at all of your open windows.</p> <h5>Integrated FaceTime Webcam</h5> <p>You''ll be able to easily connect with friends, family, and business colleagues using the MacBook Air''s FaceTime camera, which is integrated into the thin bezel above the display. And with Apple''s FaceTime application, you''re not limited to video chats with other Macs--you can now make video calls to iPhone and iPod touch users (Wi-Fi connection required for mobile users).</p> <div class="rightImage" style="width:350px"> <img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/apple/apple-macbookair-q410-13-keyboard-sm.jpg" width="350" height="291" alt="13.3-inch Apple MacBook Air keyboard" /><div class="imageCaption">The spacious, full-sized keyboard (see larger image).</div> </div> <h5>Intel Core 2 Duo Processing</h5> <p>Combining fast processing speeds with power-saving features, the Intel Core 2 Duo processor provides greater multitasking performance by combining two independent processor cores while also reducing power requirements and saving on battery life. This Intel Core 2 Duo processor has a 1.86 GHz processor speed, fast 1066 MHz front-side bus (FSB), and 6 MB L2 cache. (An L2, or secondary, cache temporarily stores data; and a larger L2 cache can help speed up your system''s performance. The FSB carries data between the CPU and RAM, and a faster front-side bus will deliver better overall performance.)</p> <h5>High Performance Graphics</h5> <p>Powered by the NVIDIA GeForce 320M graphics card, the MacBook Air allows you to view flawless video in full screen HD and play the latest games with fast frame rate.

The Apple Magic uses the same Multi-Touch technology found on the MacBook Pro, giving you a whole new way to control and interact with what''s on your screen. Swiping through pages online feels just like flipping through pages in a book or magazine. Inertial scrolling makes moving up and down a page more natural than ever. And users can press down anywhere on the Multi-Touch surface to physically click or double-click on an item--no clumsy buttons involved. <p> <h4>The Largest Multi-Touch Trackpad Ever</h4> <table align=right width=300 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/electronics/B003XIJ3MW-1._.jpg" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The Apple Magic Trackpad responds to a variety of finger gestures for clicking, scrolling, and swiping. </b></i></small> </td></tr></table> The Magic Trackpad is just like the trackpad on the MacBook Pro--but bigger. It''s made with the same advanced touch-friendly and wear-resistant glass surface, but with nearly 80 percent more area. This gives you even more room to scroll, swipe, pinch, and rotate to your fingers'' content. And because the entire surface is a button that clicks, you can use it in place of a mouse without losing a hint of functionality. The Magic Trackpad''s full set of gestures includes two-finger scrolling, pinching to zoom, rotating with your fingertips, three-finger swiping, and activating Expose or switching between applications with four fingers. <p> Plus, the trackpad is customizable. Simply access the Magic Trackpad pane in System Preferences to enable gestures you want and disable those you don''t. <h4>Seamless Wireless Design</h4> The Magic Trackpad fits in perfectly with your Mac desktop, with the same sculpted aluminum design as the Apple Wireless Keyboard. In fact, side by side the two sit flush at the same angle and height. This lets you go from trackpad to keyboard in a single motion, or do both at the same time. How perfect is that? <p> The Magic Trackpad connects to your Mac via Bluetooth wireless technology, so you don''t have to deal with an annoying cable that dictates where you place it. Once you pair the Magic Trackpad with your Bluetooth-enabled Mac, you''ll enjoy a reliable, secure connection up to 33 feet away. In addition, the Magic Trackpad detects periods of inactivity, with an automatic shutoff feature that saves battery life. As an alternative, you can turn it off yourself. Both options keep you gesturing for months at a time. <p> The Magic Trackpad--which can work in place of a mouse or in conjunction with the mouse on any Mac computer (even a notebook)--requires a Bluetooth-enabled Mac computer, two AA batteries (included), Mac OS X Snow Leopard v 10.6.4, and the latest software update. <table align=center width=750 cellpadding=10> <tr><td><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/stores/electronics/B003XIJ3MW-2._.jpg" border=0 align=top><br><br><small><i><b>The trackpad sits flush with the Apple Wireless Keyboard, making it easy to switch between the two. </b></i></small> </td></tr></table> </div>',2,NULL,N'v-b003xij3mw',N'20120319 22:02:01.780',N'20120319 22:02:01.780',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');

This compact unit is full-featured enough for the multimedia enthusiast but easy enough to navigate through and use for the complete digital-age newcomer, and it''s the perfect companion for everything from sitting on a bus on your way to school, to going to the gym.<p>  The primary purpose of the Samsung YP-T9JAB is, of course, to play music, for which this audio player is well equipped. Compatible with MP3, WMA, and protected WMA DRM (digital rights management) 10 audio formats, the T9 features DNSe (digital natural sound engine) technology for a clear, full sound, and a 9-band customizable EQ with 11 preset modes for all types of musical preferences. This unit supports playlists, as well as an internal favorites list that acts as an on-the-go playlist, and is subscription service compatible (Janus DRM). All the regular modes of playback are included, such as repeat, repeat one, shuffle, and normal, but this unit also includes a variable playback speed setting that speeds-up or slows-down your music from 3x to -3x the recorded speed. Furthermore, to protect your sensitive hearing Samsung''s T9 series has an option to limit the audio output level so you don''t accidentally damage your ears due to uneven recording volumes.<p>  Unlike many MP3 players, the YP-T9JAB doesn''t just limit you to the music you already have. The built-in FM tuner will scan the entire FM range in under 60 seconds, and automatically place the available FM stations in to presets. To eliminate stations with marginal reception, users can adjust the sensitivity to only preset stations with a strong reception. What''s more, the T9 will actually let you record directly from FM in MP3 format for playback later, even allowing you to select recording quality ranging from 96 to 192 kbps. And since this unit has a built-in microphone as well, you can also choose to record live sound or your own audio notes, also in MP3 format ranging from 32 to 128 kbps in quality, so you never need to miss a lecture or catch every word of a presentation again.<p>  More than just a music player, the Samsung YP-T9JAB supports the playback of video in the MPEG4 file format, with a video resolution of 208 x 176 pixels at a frame rate of 15 fps. This unit even comes with Samsung''s Multimedia Software that transcodes the video on your computer before transferring it to your multimedia player so the files on your T9 play at an optimal frame size and rate with minimal effort on your part. This Samsung multimedia player will also allow you to view JPEG images, complete with the ability to zoom and re-center an image, and set any saved JPEG image as your wallpaper to be used during music playback. And for those users constantly on the go, the YP-T9JAB allows you to view text files in customizable views, and delete files directly from your player without having to use a computer, so you can download the mornings email and take it with you on your way to the office, school, or an important meeting. But Samsung doesn''t stop there, preloading the T9 with built-in flash games including Baseball and Pizza Delivery, as well as the ability to download new flash games and even delete current ones to make room for more.<p>  The Samsung T9 multimedia player is built with a macromedia portable user interface with simple, intuitive menus and a 5-button front side controller. Menu navigation as well as video and pictures are displayed on a sharp, clear 1.8-inch TFT LCD with 262,000 colors and an adjustable brightness ranging from zero to 10. This unit supports 16 different languages for your menu view, and 32 different languages for ID3 tag information. The T9 allows you to choose between five different menu colors, even allowing you to shuffle colors at random so you get a different one every time you turn the unit on. During music playback you can set the display to show flash visualizers, JPEG photos, or the album cover art of what is playing, and power-saving features let you adjust your screen saver, sleep timer, LCD off and auto power-off settings.<p>  The Samsung YP-T9JAB comes with four gigabytes of internal flash memory for storing up to 1,000 songs at 128 kbps, up to 40,000 JPEG photos, or up to 276 hours of audio recordings at 32 kbps. This unit has a built-in, rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery with a capacity of 740 mAh that allows up to 30 hours of audio play time, or up to six hours of video play time. The Samsung T9 has a 20 mWatts per-channel output, and includes a USB 2.0 connector for interfacing with your PC, as well as a 24-pin UART (universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter) chip and 3.5mm earphone out connector. This multimedia player requires Windows XP or higher for subscription services, and comes with a pair of EP-370 balanced earphones so you can start listening to your music from the very first day.

And all night.</strong><br /> The built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery gives you up to 24 hours of nonstop music. So when you clip on an 8GB or 16GB iPod nano, you''ll have plenty of tunes to make it through your commute, your workout, and beyond.</p> <p><strong>Shake it up.</strong><br /> Now for something completely random. Give iPod nano a shake and it shuffles to a different song in your music library. Shake to Shuffle is perfect for when you''re not in any particular music mood. You never know what you''re going to hear, and you''ll always be pleasantly surprised.</p> <h2>Genius.

Lace up a pair of Nike+ running shoes and clip on your iPod nano. You''ll watch the miles unfold and hear real-time voice feedback along with your favorite songs. In the gym, connect iPod nano to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio machine. It records your pace, time, and distance as you work out and rock out.</p> <h2>iTunes. For your iPod-playing pleasure.</h2> <p><strong>Everything you need to be entertained.</strong><br /> iTunes is the best way to fill your iPod nano with the latest music, podcasts, audiobooks, and more.

You can make your own playlists, create Genius playlists, choose Genius Mixes, and sync it all to your iPod nano. And you can download iTunes free.</p> <p><strong>The world''s #1 music store.</strong><br /> Load your iPod nano with your favorite tunes. Or browse over 13 million songs and discover even more.

Click once to buy the song and it starts downloading instantly. It''s the fastest, easiest way to build a digital music collection for your iPod nano.</p> <h2>Accessibility</h2> <p><strong>Built-in accessibility.</strong><br /> iPod nano comes with accessibility features that help people with disabilities enjoy music, audiobooks, and more.</p> <p><strong>VoiceOver</strong><br /> iPod nano features VoiceOver, the world''s first gesture-based screen reader. Touch the screen to hear a description of the item under your finger, then double-tap, drag, or flick to control iPod nano. Use the optional Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic to control your music without looking at the screen. VoiceOver tells you the name of the song or artist--and it speaks 29 languages.</p> <p><strong>White on Black</strong><br /> If you prefer higher contrast, iPod nano lets you change the display to white on black. Use the White on Black feature in any application, as well as on the Home screen.</p>  <p><strong>Mono Audio</strong><br /> If your hearing is limited in one ear, turn on Mono Audio to route audio into both earbuds so you can hear both channels in either ear.</p> <h2>What''s in the Box</h2> <p>16GB iPod nano (Blue), Apple Earphones, Dock Connector to USB Cable, Quick Start Guide and Important Product Information</p>',2,NULL,N'v-b002m3so10',N'20120319 22:01:02.267',N'20120319 22:01:02.267',N'EditorialReview',N'en-us');
